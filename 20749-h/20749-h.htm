ST. RONAN'S WELL.</h2>


<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;<span class="smcap">St. Ronan's Well</span>&rsquo; is not so much my favourite as certain of its
predecessors,&rdquo; Lady Louisa Stuart wrote to Scott on March 26, 1824. &ldquo;Yet
still I see the author's hand in it, <i>et c'est tout dire</i>. Meg Dods, the
meeting&rdquo; (vol. i. chap. ix.), &ldquo;and the last scene between Clara and her
brother, are marked with the true stamp, not to be matched or mistaken.
Is the Siege of Ptolemais really on the anvil?&rdquo; she goes on, speaking of
the projected Crusading Tales, and obviously anxious to part company
with &ldquo;St. Ronan's Well.&rdquo; All judgments have not agreed with Lady
Louisa's. There is a literary legend or fable according to which a
number of distinguished men, all admirers of Scott, wrote down
separately the name of their favourite Waverley novel, and all, when the
papers were compared, had written &ldquo;St. Ronan's.&rdquo; Sydney Smith, writing
to Constable on Dec. 28, 1823, described the new story as &ldquo;far the best
that has appeared for some time. Every now and then there is some
mistaken or overcharged humour&mdash;but much excellent delineation of
character, the story very well told, and the whole very interesting.
Lady Binks, the old landlady, and Touchwood are all very good. Mrs.
Blower particularly so. So are MacTurk and Lady Penelope. I wish he
would give his people better names; Sir Bingo Binks is quite
ridiculous.... The curtain should have dropped on finding Clara's<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_x" id="vol_i_Page_x">[Pg&nbsp;x]</a></span>
glove. Some of the serious scenes with Clara and her brother are very
fine: the knife scene masterly. In her light and gay moments Clara is
very vulgar; but Sir Walter always fails in well-bred men and women, and
yet who has seen more of both? and who, in the ordinary intercourse of
society, is better bred? Upon the whole, I call this a very successful
exhibition.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We have seldom found Sydney Smith giving higher praise, and nobody can
deny the justice of the censure with which it is qualified. Scott
himself explains, in his Introduction, how, in his quest of novelty, he
invaded modern life, and the domain of Miss Austen. Unhappily he proved
by example the truth of his own opinion that he could do &ldquo;the big
bow-wow strain&rdquo; very well, but that it was not his <i>celebrare domestica
facta</i>. Unlike George Sand, Sir Walter had humour abundantly, but, as
the French writer said of herself, he was wholly destitute of <i>esprit</i>.</p>

<p>We need not linger over definition of these qualities; but we must
recognise, in Scott, the absence of lightness of touch, of delicacy in
the small sword-play of conversation. In fencing, all should be done,
the masters tell us, with the fingers. Scott works not even with the
wrist, but with the whole arm. The two-handed sword, the old claymore,
are his weapons, not the rapier. This was plain enough in the
word-combats of Queen Mary and her lady gaoler in Loch Leven. Much more
conspicuous is the &ldquo;swashing blow&rdquo; in the repartee of &ldquo;St. Ronan's.&rdquo; The
insults lavished on Lady Binks are violent and cruel; even Clara Mowbray
taunts her. Now Lady Binks is in the same parlous case as the
postmistress who dreed penance &ldquo;for ante-nup,&rdquo; as Meg Dods says in an
interrupted harangue, and we know that, to the author's mind, Clara
Mowbray had no right to throw stones. All these jeers are offensive to
generous feeling, and in the mouth of Clara<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_xi" id="vol_i_Page_xi">[Pg&nbsp;xi]</a></span> are intolerable. Lockhart
remarked in Scott a singular bluntness of the sense of smell and of
taste. He could drink corked wine without a suspicion that there was
anything wrong with it. This curious obtuseness of a physical sense, in
one whose eyesight was so keen, who, &ldquo;aye was the first to find the
hare&rdquo; in coursing, seems to correspond with his want of lightness in the
invention of <i>badinage</i>. He tells us that, for a long while at least, he
had been unacquainted with the kind of society, the idle, useless
underbred society, of watering-places. Are we to believe that the
company at Gilsland, for instance, where he met and wooed Miss
Charpentier, was like the company at St. Ronan's? Lockhart vouches for
the snobbishness, &ldquo;the mean admiration of mean things,&rdquo; the devotion to
the slimmest appearances of rank. All this is credible enough, but, if
there existed a society as dull and base as that which we meet in the
pages of &ldquo;Mr. Soapy Sponge,&rdquo; and Surtees's other novels, assuredly it
was no theme for the great and generous spirit of Sir Walter. The worst
kind of manners always prevail among people whom moderns call &ldquo;the
second-rate smart,&rdquo; and these are drawn in &ldquo;St. Ronan's Well.&rdquo; But we
may believe that, even there, manners are no longer quite so hideous as
in the little Tweedside watering-place. The extinction of duelling has
destroyed, or nearly destroyed, the swaggering style of truculence;
people could not behave as Mowbray and Sir Bingo behave to Tyrrel, in
the after-dinner scene. The Man of Peace, the great MacTurk, with his
harangues translated from the language of Ossian, is no longer needed,
and no longer possible. Supposing manners to be correctly described in
&ldquo;St. Ronan's,&rdquo; the pessimist himself must admit that manners have
improved. But it is not without regret that we see a genius born for
chivalry labouring in this unworthy and alien matter.<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_xii" id="vol_i_Page_xii">[Pg&nbsp;xii]</a></span></p>

<p>The English critics delighted to accuse Scott of having committed
literary suicide. He had only stepped off the path to which he presently
returned. He was unfitted to write the domestic novel, and even in &ldquo;St.
Ronan's&rdquo; he introduces events of romantic improbability. These enable
him to depict scenes of the most passionate tragedy, as in the meeting
of Clara and Tyrrel. They who have loved so blindly and so kindly should
never have met, or never parted. It is like a tragic rendering of the
scene where Diana Vernon and Osbaldistone encounter each other on the
moonlit moor. The wild words of Clara, &ldquo;Is it so, and was it even
yourself whom I saw even now?... And, all things considered, I do carry
on the farce of life wonderfully well,&rdquo;&mdash;all this passage, with the
silence of the man, is on the highest level of poetic invention, and
Clara ranks with Ophelia. To her strain of madness we may ascribe,
perhaps, what Sydney Smith calls the vulgarity of her lighter moments.
But here the genius of Shakspeare is faultless, where Scott's is most
faulty and most mistaken.</p>

<p>Much confusion is caused in &ldquo;St. Ronan's Well&rdquo; by Scott's concession to
the delicacy of James Ballantyne. What has shaken Clara's brain? Not her
sham marriage, for that was innocent, and might be legally annulled.
Lockhart writes (vii. 208): &ldquo;Sir Walter had shown a remarkable degree of
good-nature in the composition of this novel. When the end came in view,
James Ballantyne suddenly took vast alarm about a particular feature in
the heroine's history. In the original conception, and in the book as
actually written and printed, Miss Mowbray's mock marriage had not
halted at the profane ceremony of the church; and the delicate printer
shrank from the idea of obtruding on the fastidious public the
possibility of any personal contamination having occurred to a high-born
damsel of<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_xiii" id="vol_i_Page_xiii">[Pg&nbsp;xiii]</a></span> the nineteenth century.&rdquo; Scott answered: &ldquo;You would never
have quarrelled with it had the thing happened to a girl in gingham&mdash;the
silk petticoat can make little difference.&rdquo; &ldquo;James reclaimed with double
energy, and called Constable to the rescue; and, after some pause, the
author very reluctantly consented to cancel and re-write about
twenty-four pages, which was enough to obliterate, to a certain extent,
the dreaded scandal&mdash;and, in a similar degree, as he always persisted,
to perplex and weaken the course of his narrative, and the dark effect
of its catastrophe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>From a communication printed in the &ldquo;Athen&aelig;um&rdquo; of Feb. 4, 1893, extracts
from the original proof-sheets, it seems that Lockhart forgot the
original plan of the novel. The mock marriage <i>did</i> halt at the church
door, but Clara's virtue had yielded to her real lover, Tyrrel, before
the ceremony. Hannah Irwin had deliberately made opportunities for the
lovers' meeting, and at last, as she says, in a cancelled passage, &ldquo;the
devil and Hannah Irwin prevailed.&rdquo; There followed remorse, and a
determination not to meet again before the Church made them one, and, on
the head of this, the mock marriage shook Clara's reason. This was the
original plan; it declares itself in the scene between Tyrrel and Clara
(vol. i. chap, ix.): &ldquo;Wherefore should not sorrow be the end of sin and
folly?&rdquo; The reviewer in the &ldquo;Monthly Review&rdquo; (1824) says &ldquo;there is a
hint of some deeper cause of grief (see the confession to the brother),
but it is highly problematical.&rdquo; For all this the delicacy of James
Ballantyne is to blame&mdash;his delicacy, and Scott's concessions to a
respectable man and a bad critic.</p>

<p>The origin of &ldquo;St. Ronan's Well&rdquo; has been described by Lockhart in a
familiar passage. As Laidlaw, Scott, and Lockhart were riding along the
brow of the triple-peaked Eildon Hills, Scott mentioned &ldquo;the row&rdquo; that<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_xiv" id="vol_i_Page_xiv">[Pg&nbsp;xiv]</a></span>
was going on in Paris about &ldquo;Quentin Durward.&rdquo; &ldquo;I can't but think I
could make better play still with something German,&rdquo; he said. Laidlaw
grumbled at this: &ldquo;You are always best, like Helen MacGregor, when your
foot is on your native heath; and I have often thought that if you were
to write a novel, and lay the scene <i>here</i> in the very year you were
writing it, you would exceed yourself.&rdquo; &ldquo;Hame's hame,&rdquo; quoth Scott,
smiling, &ldquo;be it ever sae hamely,&rdquo; and Laidlaw bade him &ldquo;stick to Melrose
in 1823.&rdquo; It was now that Scott spoke of the village tragedy, the
romance of every house, of every cottage, and told a tale of some
horrors in the hamlet that lies beyond Melrose, on the north side of
Tweed. Laidlaw and Lockhart believed that this conversation suggested
&ldquo;St. Ronan's Well,&rdquo; the scene of which has been claimed as their own by
the people of Innerleithen. This little town is beautifully situated
where the hills of Tweed are steepest, and least resemble the <i>bosses
verd&acirc;tres</i> of Prosper M&eacute;rim&eacute;e. It is now a manufacturing town, like its
neighbours, and contributes its quota to the pollution of &ldquo;the
glittering and resolute streams of Tweed.&rdquo; The pilgrim will scarce rival
Tyrrel's feat of catching a clean-run salmon in summer, but the scenes
are extremely pleasing, and indeed, from this point to Dryburgh, the
beautiful and fabled river is at its loveliest. It is possible that a
little inn farther up the water, &ldquo;The Crook,&rdquo; on the border of the
moorland, and near Tala Linn, where the Covenanters held a famous
assembly, may have suggested the name of the &ldquo;Cleikum.&rdquo; Lockhart
describes the prosperity which soon flowed into Innerleithen, and the
St. Ronan's Games, at which the Ettrick Shepherd presided gleefully.
They are still held, or were held very lately, but there will never come
again such another Shepherd, or such contests with the Flying Tailor of
Ettrick.<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_xv" id="vol_i_Page_xv">[Pg&nbsp;xv]</a></span></p>

<p>Apart from the tragedy of Clara, doubtless the better parts of &ldquo;St.
Ronan's Well&rdquo; are the Scotch characters. Even our generation remembers
many a Meg Dods, and he who writes has vividly in his recollection just
such tartness, such goodness of heart, such ungoverned eloquence and
vigour of rebuke as made Meg famous, successful on the stage, and
welcome to her countrymen. These people, Mrs. Blower and Meg, are
Shakspearean, they live with Dame Quickly and Shallow, in the hearts of
Scots, but to the English general they are possibly caviare. In the
gallant and irascible MacTurk we have the waning Highlander: he
resembles the Captain of Knockdunder in &ldquo;The Heart of Mid Lothian,&rdquo; or
an exaggerated and ill-educated Hector of &ldquo;The Antiquary.&rdquo; Concerning
the women of the tale, it may be said that Lady Binks has great
qualities, and appears to have been drawn &ldquo;with an eye on the object,&rdquo;
as Wordsworth says, and from the life. Lady Penelope seems more
exaggerated now than she probably did at the time, for the fashion of
affectation changes. The Winterblossoms and Quacklebens are accurate
enough in themselves, but are seen through a Blackwoodian atmosphere, as
it were, through a mist of the temporary and boisterous Scotch humour of
the day. The author occasionally stoops to a pun, and, like that which
Hood made in the hearing of Thackeray, the pun is not good. Indeed the
novel, in its view of the decay of the Border, the ruined Laird, the
frivolous foolish society of the Well, taking the place of sturdy
William of Deloraine, and farmers like Scott's grandfather, makes a
picture of decadence as melancholy as &ldquo;Redgauntlet.&rdquo; &ldquo;Not here, O
Apollo, are haunts meet for thee!&rdquo; Strangely enough, among the features
of the time, Scott mentions reckless borrowings, &ldquo;accommodation,&rdquo; &ldquo;Banks
of Air.&rdquo; His own business was based on a &ldquo;Bank of Air,&rdquo; &ldquo;wind-capital,&rdquo;
as Cadell, Constable's partner, calls it,<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_xvi" id="vol_i_Page_xvi">[Pg&nbsp;xvi]</a></span> and the bubble was just about
to burst, though Scott had no apprehension of financial ruin. A horrid
power is visible in Scott's second picture of <i>la mauvaise pauvre</i>, the
hag who despises and curses the givers of &ldquo;handfuls of coals and of
rice;&rdquo; his first he drew in the witches of &ldquo;The Bride of Lammermoor.&rdquo; He
has himself indicated his desire to press hard on the vice of gambling,
as in &ldquo;The Fortunes of Nigel.&rdquo; Ruinous at all times and in every shape,
gambling, in Scott's lifetime, during the Regency, had crippled or
destroyed many an historical Scottish family. With this in his mind he
drew the portrait of Mowbray of St. Ronan's. His picture of duelling is
not more seductive; he himself had lost his friend, Sir Alexander
Boswell, in a duel; on other occasions this institution had brought
discomfort into his life, and though he was ready to fight General
Gourgaud with Napoleon's pistols, he cannot have approved of the
practices of the MacTurks and Bingo Binkses. A maniac, as his
correspondence shows, challenged Sir Walter, insisting that he was
pointed at and ridiculed in the character of MacTurk. (Abbotsford MSS.)
It is interesting to have the picture of contemporary manners from
Scott's hand&mdash;Meg Dods remains among his immortal portraits; but a novel
in which the absurd will of fiction and the conventional Nabob are
necessary machinery can never be ranked so high as even &ldquo;The Monastery&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Peveril.&rdquo; In Scotland, however, it was infinitely more successful
than its admirable successor &ldquo;Redgauntlet.&rdquo;</p>

TO<br />
<br />
ST. RONAN'S WELL.</h2>


<p>The novel which follows is upon a plan different from any other that the
author has ever written, although it is perhaps the most legitimate
which relates to this kind of light literature.</p>

<p>It is intended, in a word&mdash;<i>celebrare domestica facta</i>&mdash;to give an
imitation of the shifting manners of our own time, and paint scenes, the
originals of which are daily passing round us, so that a minute's
observation may compare the copies with the originals. It must be
confessed that this style of composition was adopted by the author
rather from the tempting circumstance of its offering some novelty in
his compositions, and avoiding worn-out characters and positions, than
from the hope of rivalling the many formidable competitors who have
already won deserved honours in this department. The ladies, in
particular, gifted by nature with keen powers of observation and light
satire, have been so distinguished by these works of talent, that,
reckoning from the authoress of Evelina to her of Marriage, a catalogue
might be made, including the brilliant and talented names of Edgeworth,
Austin, Charlotte Smith, and others, whose success seems to have
appropriated this province of the novel as exclusively their own. It was
therefore with a sense of temerity that the author intruded upon a
species of composition which had been of late practised with such
distinguished success. This consciousness was lost, however, under the
necessity of<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_xviii" id="vol_i_Page_xviii">[Pg&nbsp;xviii]</a></span> seeking for novelty, without which, it was much to be
apprehended, such repeated incursions on his part would nauseate the
long indulgent public at the last.</p>

<p>The scene chosen for the author's little drama of modern life was a
mineral spring, such as are to be found in both divisions of Britain,
and which are supplied with the usual materials for redeeming health, or
driving away care. The invalid often finds relief from his complaints,
less from the healing virtues of the Spa itself, than because his system
of ordinary life undergoes an entire change, in his being removed from
his ledger and account-books&mdash;from his legal folios and progresses of
title-deeds&mdash;from his counters and shelves,&mdash;from whatever else forms
the main source of his constant anxiety at home, destroys his appetite,
mars the custom of his exercise, deranges the digestive powers, and
clogs up the springs of life. Thither, too, comes the saunterer, anxious
to get rid of that wearisome attendant <i>himself</i>, and thither come both
males and females, who, upon a different principle, desire to make
themselves double.</p>

<p>The society of such places is regulated, by their very nature, upon a
scheme much more indulgent than that which rules the world of fashion,
and the narrow circles of rank in the metropolis. The titles of rank,
birth, and fortune, are received at a watering-place without any very
strict investigation, as adequate to the purpose for which they are
preferred; and as the situation infers a certain degree of intimacy and
sociability for the time, so to whatever heights it may have been
carried, it is not understood to imply any duration beyond the length of
the season. No intimacy can be supposed more close for the time, and
more transitory in its endurance, than that which is attached to a
watering-place acquaintance. The novelist, therefore, who fixes upon
such a scene for his tale, endeavours to display a<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_xix" id="vol_i_Page_xix">[Pg&nbsp;xix]</a></span> species of society,
where the strongest contrast of humorous characters and manners may be
brought to bear on and illustrate each other with less violation of
probability, than could be supposed to attend the same miscellaneous
assemblage in any other situation.</p>

<p>In such scenes, too, are frequently mingled characters, not merely
ridiculous, but dangerous and hateful. The unprincipled gamester, the
heartless fortune-hunter, all those who eke out their means of
subsistence by pandering to the vices and follies of the rich and gay,
who drive, by their various arts, foibles into crimes, and imprudence
into acts of ruinous madness, are to be found where their victims
naturally resort, with the same certainty that eagles are gathered
together at the place of slaughter. By this the author takes a great
advantage for the management of his story, particularly in its darker
and more melancholy passages. The impostor, the gambler, all who live
loose upon the skirts of society, or, like vermin, thrive by its
corruptions, are to be found at such retreats, when they easily, and as
a matter of course, mingle with those dupes, who might otherwise have
escaped their snares. But besides those characters who are actually
dangerous to society, a well-frequented watering-place generally
exhibits for the amusement of the company, and the perplexity and
amazement of the more inexperienced, a sprinkling of persons called by
the newspapers eccentric characters&mdash;individuals, namely, who, either
from some real derangement of their understanding, or, much more
frequently, from an excess of vanity, are ambitious of distinguishing
themselves by some striking peculiarity in dress or address,
conversation or manners, and perhaps in all. These affectations are
usually adopted, like Drawcansir's extravagances, to show <i>they dare</i>;
and I must needs say, those who profess them are more frequently to be
found among the<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_xx" id="vol_i_Page_xx">[Pg&nbsp;xx]</a></span> English, than among the natives of either of the other
two divisions of the united kingdoms. The reason probably is, that the
consciousness of wealth, and a sturdy feeling of independence, which
generally pervade the English nation, are, in a few individuals,
perverted into absurdity, or at least peculiarity. The witty Irishman,
on the contrary, adapts his general behaviour to that of the best
society, or that which he thinks such; nor is it any part of the shrewd
Scot's national character unnecessarily to draw upon himself public
attention. These rules, however, are not without their exceptions; for
we find men of every country playing the eccentric at these independent
resorts of the gay and the wealthy, where every one enjoys the license
of doing what is good in his own eyes.</p>

<p>It scarce needed these obvious remarks to justify a novelist's choice of
a watering-place as the scene of a fictitious narrative. Unquestionably,
it affords every variety of character, mixed together in a manner which
cannot, without a breach of probability, be supposed to exist elsewhere;
neither can it be denied that in the concourse which such miscellaneous
collections of persons afford, events extremely different from those of
the quiet routine of ordinary life may, and often do, take place.</p>

<p>It is not, however, sufficient that a mine be in itself rich and easily
accessible; it is necessary that the engineer who explores it should
himself, in mining phrase, have an accurate knowledge of the <i>country</i>,
and possess the skill necessary to work it to advantage. In this
respect, the author of Saint Ronan's Well could not be termed fortunate.
His habits of life had not led him much, of late years at least, into
its general or bustling scenes, nor had he mingled often in the society
which enables the observer to &ldquo;shoot folly as it flies.&rdquo; The consequence
perhaps was, that the<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_xxi" id="vol_i_Page_xxi">[Pg&nbsp;xxi]</a></span> characters wanted that force and precision which
can only be given by a writer who is familiarly acquainted with his
subject. The author, however, had the satisfaction to chronicle his
testimony against the practice of gambling, a vice which the devil has
contrived to render all his own, since it is deprived of whatever pleads
an apology for other vices, and is founded entirely on the cold-blooded
calculation of the most exclusive selfishness. The character of the
traveller, meddling, self-important, and what the ladies call fussing,
but yet generous and benevolent in his purposes, was partly taken from
nature. The story, being entirely modern, cannot require much
explanation, after what has been here given, either in the shape of
notes, or a more prolix introduction.</p>

<p>It may be remarked, that the English critics, in many instances, though
none of great influence, pursued Saint Ronan's Well with hue and cry,
many of the fraternity giving it as their opinion that the author had
exhausted himself, or, as the technical phrase expresses it, written
himself out; and as an unusual tract of success too often provokes many
persons to mark and exaggerate a slip when it does occur, the author was
publicly accused, in prose and verse, of having committed a literary
suicide in this unhappy attempt. The voices, therefore, were, for a
time, against Saint Ronan's on the southern side of the Tweed.</p>

<p>In the author's own country, it was otherwise. Many of the characters
were recognised as genuine Scottish portraits, and the good fortune
which had hitherto attended the productions of the Author of Waverley,
did not desert, notwithstanding the ominous vaticinations of its
censurers, this new attempt, although out of his ordinary style.</p>

<p>Although few, if any, of the countries of Europe, have increased so
rapidly in wealth and cultivation as Scotland during the last half
century, Sultan Mahmoud's owls might nevertheless have found in
Caledonia, at any term within that flourishing period, their dowery of
ruined villages. Accident or local advantages have, in many instances,
transferred the inhabitants of ancient hamlets, from the situations
which their predecessors chose with more respect to security than
convenience, to those in which their increasing industry and commerce
could more easily expand itself; and hence places which stand
distinguished in Scottish history, and which figure in David M'Pherson's
excellent historical map,<a name="vol_i_FNanchor_A_24" id="vol_i_FNanchor_A_24"></a><a href="#vol_i_Footnote_A_24" class="fnanchor">[A]</a><a name="vol_i_FNanchor_1_1" id="vol_i_FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#vol_i_Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> can now only be discerned from the wild<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_2" id="vol_i_Page_2">[Pg&nbsp;2]</a></span>
moor by the verdure which clothes their site, or, at best, by a few
scattered ruins, resembling pinfolds, which mark the spot of their
former existence.</p>

<p>The little village of St. Ronan's, though it had not yet fallen into the
state of entire oblivion we have described, was, about twenty years
since, fast verging towards it. The situation had something in it so
romantic, that it provoked the pencil of every passing tourist; and we
will endeavour, therefore, to describe it in language which can scarcely
be less intelligible than some of their sketches, avoiding, however, for
reasons which seem to us of weight, to give any more exact indication of
the site, than that it is on the southern side of the Forth, and not
above thirty miles distant from the English frontier.</p>

<p>A river of considerable magnitude pours its streams through a narrow
vale, varying in breadth from two miles to a fourth of that distance,
and which, being composed of rich alluvial soil, is, and has long been,
enclosed, tolerably well inhabited, and cultivated with all the skill of
Scottish agriculture. Either side of this valley is bounded by a chain
of hills, which, on the right in particular, may be almost termed
mountains. Little brooks arising in these ridges, and finding their way
to the river, offer each its own little vale to the industry of the
cultivator. Some of them bear fine large trees, which have as yet
escaped the axe, and upon the sides of most there are scattered patches
and fringes of natural copsewood, above and around which the banks of
the stream arise, somewhat desolate in the colder months, but in summer
glowing with dark purple heath, or with the golden lustre of the broom
and gorse. This is a sort of scenery<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_3" id="vol_i_Page_3">[Pg&nbsp;3]</a></span> peculiar to those countries, which
abound, like Scotland, in hills and in streams, and where the traveller
is ever and anon discovering in some intricate and unexpected recess, a
simple and silvan beauty, which pleases him the more, that it seems to
be peculiarly his own property as the first discoverer.</p>

<p>In one of these recesses, and so near its opening as to command the
prospect of the river, the broader valley, and the opposite chain of
hills, stood, and, unless neglect and desertion have completed their
work, still stands, the ancient and decayed village of St. Ronan's. The
site was singularly picturesque, as the straggling street of the village
ran up a very steep hill, on the side of which were clustered, as it
were, upon little terraces, the cottages which composed the place,
seeming, as in the Swiss towns on the Alps, to rise above each other
towards the ruins of an old castle, which continued to occupy the crest
of the eminence, and the strength of which had doubtless led the
neighbourhood to assemble under its walls for protection. It must,
indeed, have been a place of formidable defence, for, on the side
opposite to the town, its walls rose straight up from the verge of a
tremendous and rocky precipice, whose base was washed by Saint Ronan's
burn, as the brook was entitled. On the southern side, where the
declivity was less precipitous, the ground had been carefully levelled
into successive terraces, which ascended to the summit of the hill, and
were, or rather had been, connected by staircases of stone, rudely
ornamented. In peaceful periods these terraces had been occupied by the
gardens of the Castle, and in times of siege they added to its security,
for each commanded the one immediately below it, so that they could be
separately and successively<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_4" id="vol_i_Page_4">[Pg&nbsp;4]</a></span> defended, and all were exposed to the fire
from the place itself&mdash;a massive square tower of the largest size,
surrounded, as usual, by lower buildings, and a high embattled wall. On
the northern side arose a considerable mountain, of which the descent
that lay between the eminence on which the Castle was situated seemed a
detached portion, and which had been improved and deepened by three
successive huge trenches. Another very deep trench was drawn in front of
the main entrance from the east, where the principal gateway formed the
termination of the street, which, as we have noticed, ascended from the
village, and this last defence completed the fortifications of the
tower.</p>

<p>In the ancient gardens of the Castle, and upon all sides of it excepting
the western, which was precipitous, large old trees had found root,
mantling the rock and the ancient and ruinous walls with their dusky
verdure, and increasing the effect of the shattered pile which towered
up from the centre.</p>

<p>Seated on the threshold of this ancient pile, where the &ldquo;proud porter&rdquo;
had in former days &ldquo;rear'd himself,&rdquo;<a name="vol_i_FNanchor_2_2" id="vol_i_FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#vol_i_Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> a stranger had a complete and
commanding view of the decayed village, the houses of which, to a
fanciful imagination, might seem as if they had been suddenly arrested
in hurrying down the precipitous hill, and fixed as if by magic in the
whimsical arrangement which they now presented. It was like a sudden
pause in one of Amphion's country-dances, when the huts which were to
form the future Thebes were jigging it to his lute. But, with such an
observer, the melancholy excited by the desolate appearance of the
village soon overcame all the lighter frolics of the imagination.<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_5" id="vol_i_Page_5">[Pg&nbsp;5]</a></span>
Originally constructed on the humble plan used in the building of Scotch
cottages about a century ago, the greater part of them had been long
deserted; and their fallen roofs, blackened gables, and ruinous walls,
showed Desolation's triumph over Poverty. On some huts the rafters,
varnished with soot, were still standing, in whole or in part, like
skeletons, and a few, wholly or partially covered with thatch, seemed
still inhabited, though scarce habitable; for the smoke of the
peat-fires, which prepared the humble meal of the indwellers, stole
upwards, not only from the chimneys, its regular vent, but from various
other crevices in the roofs. Nature, in the meanwhile, always changing,
but renewing as she changes, was supplying, by the power of vegetation,
the fallen and decaying marks of human labour. Small pollards, which had
been formerly planted around the little gardens, had now waxed into huge
and high forest trees; the fruit-trees had extended their branches over
the verges of the little yards, and the hedges had shot up into huge and
irregular bushes; while quantities of dock, and nettles, and hemlock,
hiding the ruined walls, were busily converting the whole scene of
desolation into a picturesque forest-bank.</p>

<p>Two houses in St. Ronan's were still in something like decent repair;
places essential&mdash;the one to the spiritual weal of the inhabitants, the
other to the accommodation of travellers. These were the clergyman's
manse, and the village inn. Of the former we need only say, that it
formed no exception to the general rule by which the landed proprietors
of Scotland seem to proceed in lodging their clergy, not only in the
cheapest, but in the ugliest and most inconvenient house which the
genius of<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_6" id="vol_i_Page_6">[Pg&nbsp;6]</a></span> masonry can contrive. It had the usual number of
chimneys&mdash;two, namely&mdash;rising like asses' ears at either end, which
answered the purpose for which they were designed as ill as usual. It
had all the ordinary leaks and inlets to the fury of the elements, which
usually form the subject of the complaints of a Scottish incumbent to
his brethren of the presbytery; and, to complete the picture, the
clergyman being a bachelor, the pigs had unmolested admission to the
garden and court-yard, broken windows were repaired with brown paper,
and the disordered and squalid appearance of a low farm-house, occupied
by a bankrupt tenant, dishonoured the dwelling of one, who, besides his
clerical character, was a scholar and a gentleman, though a little of a
humourist.</p>

<p>Beside the manse stood the kirk of St. Ronan's, a little old mansion
with a clay floor, and an assemblage of wretched pews, originally of
carved oak, but heedfully clouted with white fir-deal. But the external
form of the church was elegant in the outline, having been built in
Catholic times, when we cannot deny to the forms of ecclesiastical
architecture that grace, which, as good Protestants, we refuse to their
doctrine. The fabric hardly raised its grey and vaulted roof among the
crumbling hills of mortality by which it was surrounded, and was indeed
so small in size, and so much lowered in height by the graves on the
outside, which ascended half way up the low Saxon windows, that it might
itself have appeared only a funeral vault, or mausoleum of larger size.
Its little square tower, with the ancient belfry, alone distinguished it
from such a monument. But when the grey-headed beadle turned the keys
with his shaking hand, the antiquary<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_7" id="vol_i_Page_7">[Pg&nbsp;7]</a></span> was admitted into an ancient
building, which, from the style of its architecture, and some monuments
of the Mowbrays of St. Ronan's, which the old man was accustomed to
point out, was generally conjectured to be as early as the thirteenth
century.</p>

<p>These Mowbrays of St. Ronan's seem to have been at one time a very
powerful family. They were allied to, and friends of the house of
Douglas, at the time when the overgrown power of that heroic race made
the Stewarts tremble on the Scottish throne. It followed that, when, as
our old <i>na&iuml;f</i> historian expresses it, &ldquo;no one dared to strive with a
Douglas, nor yet with a Douglas's man, for if he did, he was sure to
come by the waur,&rdquo; the family of St. Ronan's shared their prosperity,
and became lords of almost the whole of the rich valley of which their
mansion commanded the prospect. But upon the turning of the tide, in the
reign of James II., they became despoiled of the greater part of those
fair acquisitions, and succeeding events reduced their importance still
farther. Nevertheless, they were, in the middle of the seventeenth
century, still a family of considerable note; and Sir Reginald Mowbray,
after the unhappy battle of Dunbar, distinguished himself by the
obstinate defence of the Castle against the arms of Cromwell, who,
incensed at the opposition which he had unexpectedly encountered in an
obscure corner, caused the fortress to be dismantled and blown up with
gunpowder.</p>

<p>After this catastrophe the old Castle was abandoned to ruin; but Sir
Reginald, when, like Allan Ramsay's Sir William Worthy, he returned
after the Revolution, built himself a house in the fashion of that later
age, which he prudently suited in size to the diminished fortunes of his
family. It was<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_8" id="vol_i_Page_8">[Pg&nbsp;8]</a></span> situated about the middle of the village, whose vicinity
was not in those days judged any inconvenience, upon a spot of ground
more level than was presented by the rest of the acclivity, where, as we
said before, the houses were notched as it were into the side of the
steep bank, with little more level ground about them than the spot
occupied by their site. But the Laird's house had a court in front and a
small garden behind, connected with another garden, which, occupying
three terraces, descended, in emulation of the orchards of the old
Castle, almost to the banks of the stream.</p>

<p>The family continued to inhabit this new messuage until about fifty
years before the commencement of our history, when it was much damaged
by a casual fire; and the Laird of the day, having just succeeded to a
more pleasant and commodious dwelling at the distance of about three
miles from the village, determined to abandon the habitation of his
ancestors. As he cut down at the same time an ancient rookery, (perhaps
to defray the expenses of the migration,) it became a common remark
among the country folk, that the decay of St. Ronan's began when Laird
Lawrence and the crows flew off.</p>

<p>The deserted mansion, however, was not consigned to owls and birds of
the desert; on the contrary, for many years it witnessed more fun and
festivity than when it had been the sombre abode of a grave Scottish
Baron of &ldquo;auld lang syne.&rdquo; In short, it was converted into an inn, and
marked by a huge sign, representing on the one side St. Ronan catching
hold of the devil's game leg with his Episcopal crook, as the story may
be read in his veracious legend, and on the other the Mow<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_9" id="vol_i_Page_9">[Pg&nbsp;9]</a></span>bray arms. It
was by far the best frequented public-house in that vicinity; and a
thousand stories were told of the revels which had been held within its
walls, and the gambols achieved under the influence of its liquors. All
this, however, had long since passed away, according to the lines in my
frontispiece,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;A merry place, 'twas said, in days of yore;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But something ail'd it now,&mdash;the place was cursed.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The worthy couple (servants and favourites of the Mowbray family) who
first kept the inn, had died reasonably wealthy, after long carrying on
a flourishing trade, leaving behind them an only daughter. They had
acquired by degrees not only the property of the inn itself, of which
they were originally tenants, but of some remarkably good meadow-land by
the side of the brook, which, when touched by a little pecuniary
necessity, the Lairds of St. Ronan's had disposed of piecemeal, as the
readiest way to portion off a daughter, procure a commission for the
younger son, and the like emergencies. So that Meg Dods, when she
succeeded to her parents, was a considerable heiress, and, as such, had
the honour of refusing three topping-farmers, two bonnet-lairds, and a
horse-couper, who successively made proposals to her.</p>

<p>Many bets were laid on the horse-couper's success, but the knowing ones
were taken in. Determined to ride the fore-horse herself, Meg would
admit no helpmate who might soon assert the rights of a master; and so,
in single blessedness, and with the despotism of Queen Bess herself, she
ruled all matters with a high hand, not only over her men-servants and
maid-servants, but over the stranger<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_10" id="vol_i_Page_10">[Pg&nbsp;10]</a></span> within her gates, who, if he
ventured to oppose Meg's sovereign will and pleasure, or desire to have
either fare or accommodation different from that which she chose to
provide for him, was instantly ejected with that answer which Erasmus
tells us silenced all complaints in the German inns of his time, <i>Qu&aelig;re
aliud hospitium</i>;<a name="vol_i_FNanchor_3_3" id="vol_i_FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#vol_i_Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> or, as Meg expressed it, &ldquo;Troop aff wi' ye to
another public.&rdquo; As this amounted to a banishment in extent equal to
sixteen miles from Meg's residence, the unhappy party on whom it was
passed, had no other refuge save by deprecating the wrath of his
landlady, and resigning himself to her will. It is but justice to Meg
Dods to state, that though hers was a severe and almost despotic
government, it could not be termed a tyranny, since it was exercised,
upon the whole, for the good of the subject.</p>

<p>The vaults of the old Laird's cellar had not, even in his own day, been
replenished with more excellent wines; the only difficulty was to
prevail on Meg to look for the precise liquor you chose;&mdash;to which it
may be added, that she often became restiff when she thought a company
had had &ldquo;as much as did them good,&rdquo; and refused to furnish any more
supplies. Then her kitchen was her pride and glory; she looked to the
dressing of every dish herself, and there were some with which she
suffered no one to interfere. Such were the cock-a-leeky, and the
savoury minced collops, which rivalled in their way even the veal
cutlets of our old friend Mrs. Hall, at Ferrybridge. Meg's table-linen,
bed-linen,<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_11" id="vol_i_Page_11">[Pg&nbsp;11]</a></span> and so forth, were always home-made, of the best quality,
and in the best order; and a weary day was that to the chambermaid in
which her lynx eye discovered any neglect of the strict cleanliness
which she constantly enforced. Indeed, considering Meg's country and
calling, we were never able to account for her extreme and scrupulous
nicety, unless by supposing that it afforded her the most apt and
frequent pretext for scolding her maids; an exercise in which she
displayed so much eloquence and energy, that we must needs believe it to
have been a favourite one.<a name="vol_i_FNanchor_4_4" id="vol_i_FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#vol_i_Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>We have only further to commemorate, the moderation of Meg's reckonings,
which, when they closed the banquet, often relieved the apprehensions,
instead of saddening the heart, of the rising guest. A shilling for
breakfast, three shillings for dinner, including a pint of old port,
eighteenpence for a snug supper&mdash;such were the charges of the inn of St.
Ronan's, under this landlady of the olden world, even after the
nineteenth century had commenced; and they were ever tendered with the
pious recollection, that her good father never charged half so much, but
these weary times rendered it impossible for her to make the lawing
less.<a name="vol_i_FNanchor_5_5" id="vol_i_FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#vol_i_Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_12" id="vol_i_Page_12">[Pg&nbsp;12]</a></span></p><p>Notwithstanding all these excellent and rare properties, the inn at
Saint Ronan's shared the decay of the village to which it belonged. This
was owing to various circumstances. The high-road had been turned aside
from the place, the steepness of the street being murder (so the
postilions declared) to their post-horses. It was thought that Meg's
stern refusal to treat them with liquor, or to connive at their
exchanging for porter and whisky the corn which should feed their
cattle, had no small influence on the opinion of those respectable
gentlemen, and that a little cutting and levelling would have made the
ascent easy enough; but let that pass. This alteration of the highway
was an injury which Meg did not easily forgive to the country gentlemen,
most of whom she had recollected when children. &ldquo;Their fathers,&rdquo; she
said, &ldquo;wad not have done the like of it to a lone woman.&rdquo; Then the decay
of the village itself, which had formerly contained a set of feuars and
bonnet-lairds, who, under the name of the Chirupping Club, contrived to
drink twopenny, qualified with brandy or whisky, at least twice or
thrice a-week, was some small loss.</p>

<p>The temper and manners of the landlady scared away all customers of that
numerous class, who will<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_13" id="vol_i_Page_13">[Pg&nbsp;13]</a></span> not allow originality to be an excuse for the
breach of decorum, and who, little accustomed perhaps to attendance at
home, loved to play the great man at an inn, and to have a certain
number of bows, deferential speeches, and apologies, in answer to the
G&mdash;d d&mdash;n ye's which they bestow on the house, attendance, and
entertainment. Unto those who commenced this sort of barter in the
Clachan of Saint Ronan's, well could Meg Dods pay it back, in their own
coin; and glad they were to escape from the house with eyes not quite
scratched out, and ears not more deafened than if they had been within
hearing of a pitched battle.</p>

<p>Nature had formed honest Meg for such encounters; and as her noble soul
delighted in them, so her outward properties were in what Tony Lumpkin
calls a concatenation accordingly. She had hair of a brindled colour,
betwixt black and grey, which was apt to escape in elf-locks from under
her mutch when she was thrown into violent agitation&mdash;long skinny hands,
terminated by stout talons&mdash;grey eyes, thin lips, a robust person, a
broad, though flat chest, capital wind, and a voice that could match a
choir of fishwomen. She was accustomed to say of herself in her more
gentle moods, that her bark was worse than her bite; but what teeth
could have matched a tongue, which, when in full career, is vouched to
have been heard from the Kirk to the Castle of Saint Ronan's?</p>

<p>These notable gifts, however, had no charms for the travellers of these
light and giddy-paced times, and Meg's inn became less and less
frequented. What carried the evil to the uttermost was, that a fanciful
lady of rank in the neighbourhood chanced to recover of some imaginary
complaint by the use<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_14" id="vol_i_Page_14">[Pg&nbsp;14]</a></span> of a mineral well about a mile and a half from the
village; a fashionable doctor was found to write an analysis of the
healing waters, with a list of sundry cures; a speculative builder took
land in feu, and erected lodging-houses, shops, and even streets. At
length a tontine subscription was obtained to erect an inn, which, for
the more grace, was called a hotel; and so the desertion of Meg Dods
became general.<a name="vol_i_FNanchor_6_6" id="vol_i_FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#vol_i_Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>She had still, however, her friends and well-wishers, many of whom
thought, that as she was a lone woman, and known to be well to pass in
the world, she would act wisely to retire from public life, and take
down a sign which had no longer fascination for guests. But Meg's spirit
scorned submission, direct or implied. &ldquo;Her father's door,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;should be open to the road, till her father's bairn should be streekit
and carried out at it with her feet foremost. It was not for the
profit&mdash;there was little profit at it;&mdash;profit?&mdash;there was a dead loss;
but she wad not be dung by any of them. They maun hae a hottle,<a name="vol_i_FNanchor_7_7" id="vol_i_FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#vol_i_Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> maun
they?&mdash;and an honest public canna serve them! They may hottle that
likes; but they shall see that Lucky Dods can hottle on as lang as the
best of them&mdash;ay, though they had made a Tamteen of it, and linkit aw
their breaths of lives, whilk are in their nostrils, on end of ilk other
like a string of wild-geese, and the langest liver bruick a', (whilk was
sinful presumption,) she would match ilk ane of them as lang as her ain
wind held out.&rdquo; Fortunate it was for Meg,<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_15" id="vol_i_Page_15">[Pg&nbsp;15]</a></span> since she had formed this
doughty resolution, that although her inn had decayed in custom, her
land had risen in value in a degree which more than compensated the
balance on the wrong side of her books, and, joined to her usual
providence and economy, enabled her to act up to her lofty purpose.</p>

<p>She prosecuted her trade too with every attention to its diminished
income; shut up the windows of one half of her house, to baffle the
tax-gatherer; retrenched her furniture; discharged her pair of
post-horses, and pensioned off the old humpbacked postilion who drove
them, retaining his services, however, as an assistant to a still more
aged hostler. To console herself for restrictions by which her pride was
secretly wounded, she agreed with the celebrated Dick Tinto to re-paint
her father's sign, which had become rather undecipherable; and Dick
accordingly gilded the Bishop's crook, and augmented the horrors of the
Devil's aspect, until it became a terror to all the younger fry of the
school-house, and a sort of visible illustration of the terrors of the
arch-enemy, with which the minister endeavoured to impress their infant
minds.</p>

<p>Under this renewed symbol of her profession, Meg Dods, or Meg Dorts, as
she was popularly termed, on account of her refractory humours, was
still patronised by some steady customers. Such were the members of the
Killnakelty Hunt, once famous on the turf and in the field, but now a
set of venerable grey-headed sportsmen, who had sunk from fox-hounds to
basket-beagles and coursing, and who made an easy canter on their quiet
nags a gentle induction to a dinner at Meg's. &ldquo;A set of honest decent
men they were,&rdquo; Meg said; &ldquo;had their sang and their joke&mdash;and what for
no? Their<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_16" id="vol_i_Page_16">[Pg&nbsp;16]</a></span> bind was just a Scots pint over-head, and a tappit-hen to the
bill, and no man ever saw them the waur o't. It was thae cockle-brained
callants of the present day that would be mair owerta'en with a puir
quart than douce folk were with a magnum.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then there was a set of ancient brethren of the angle from Edinburgh,
who visited Saint Ronan's frequently in the spring and summer, a class
of guests peculiarly acceptable to Meg, who permitted them more latitude
in her premises than she was known to allow to any other body. &ldquo;They
were,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;pawky auld carles, that kend whilk side their bread
was buttered upon. Ye never kend of ony o' them ganging to the spring,
as they behoved to ca' the stinking well yonder.&mdash;Na, na&mdash;they were up
in the morning&mdash;had their parritch, wi' maybe a thimblefull of brandy,
and then awa up into the hills, eat their bit cauld meat on the heather,
and came hame at e'en with the creel full of caller trouts, and had them
to their dinner, and their quiet cogue of ale, and their drap punch, and
were set singing their catches and glees, as they ca'd them, till ten
o'clock, and then to bed, wi' God bless ye&mdash;and what for no?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thirdly, we may commemorate some ranting blades, who also came from the
metropolis to visit Saint Ronan's, attracted by the humours of Meg, and
still more by the excellence of her liquor, and the cheapness of her
reckonings. These were members of the Helter Skelter Club, of the
Wildfire Club, and other associations formed for the express purpose of
getting rid of care and sobriety. Such dashers occasioned many a racket
in Meg's house, and many a <i>bourasque</i> in Meg's temper. Various were the
arts of flattery and violence by which they<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_17" id="vol_i_Page_17">[Pg&nbsp;17]</a></span> endeavoured to get supplies
of liquor, when Meg's conscience told her they had had too much already.
Sometimes they failed, as when the croupier of the Helter Skelter got
himself scalded with the mulled wine, in an unsuccessful attempt to coax
this formidable virago by a salute; and the excellent president of the
Wildfire received a broken head from the keys of the cellar, as he
endeavoured to possess himself of these emblems of authority. But little
did these dauntless officials care for the exuberant frolics of Meg's
temper, which were to them only &ldquo;pretty Fanny's way&rdquo;&mdash;the <i>dulces
Amaryllidis ir&aelig;</i>. And Meg, on her part, though she often called them
&ldquo;drunken ne'er-do-weels, and thoroughbred High-street blackguards,&rdquo;
allowed no other person to speak ill of them in her hearing. &ldquo;They were
daft callants,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and that was all&mdash;when the drink was in, the
wit was out&mdash;ye could not put an auld head upon young shouthers&mdash;a young
cowt will canter, be it up-hill or down&mdash;and what for no?&rdquo; was her
uniform conclusion.</p>

<p>Nor must we omit, among Meg's steady customers, &ldquo;faithful amongst the
unfaithful found,&rdquo; the copper-nosed sheriff-clerk of the county, who,
when summoned by official duty to that district of the shire, warmed by
recollections of her double-brewed ale, and her generous Antigua, always
advertised that his &ldquo;Prieves,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Comptis,&rdquo; or whatever other business
was in hand, were to proceed on such a day and hour, &ldquo;within the house
of Margaret Dods, vintner in Saint Ronan's.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We have only farther to notice Meg's mode of conducting herself towards
chance travellers, who, knowing nothing of nearer or more fashionable
accommodations, or perhaps consulting rather the<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_18" id="vol_i_Page_18">[Pg&nbsp;18]</a></span> state of their purse
than of their taste, stumbled upon her house of entertainment. Her
reception of these was as precarious as the hospitality of a savage
nation to sailors shipwrecked on their coast. If the guests seemed to
have made her mansion their free choice&mdash;or if she liked their
appearance (and her taste was very capricious)&mdash;above all, if they
seemed pleased with what they got, and little disposed to criticise or
give trouble, it was all very well. But if they had come to Saint
Ronan's because the house at the Well was full&mdash;or if she disliked what
the sailor calls the cut of their jib&mdash;or if, above all, they were
critical about their accommodations, none so likely as Meg to give them
what in her country is called a <i>sloan</i>. In fact, she reckoned such
persons a part of that ungenerous and ungrateful public, for whose sake
she was keeping her house open at a dead loss, and who had left her, as
it were, a victim to her patriotic zeal.</p>

<p>Hence arose the different reports concerning the little inn of Saint
Ronan's, which some favoured travellers praised as the neatest and most
comfortable old-fashioned house in Scotland, where you had good
attendance, and good cheer, at moderate rates; while others, less
fortunate, could only talk of the darkness of the rooms, the homeliness
of the old furniture, and the detestable bad humour of Meg Dods, the
landlady.</p>

<p>Reader, if you come from the more sunny side of the Tweed&mdash;or even if,
being a Scot, you have had the advantage to be born within the last
twenty-five years, you may be induced to think this portrait of Queen
Elizabeth, in Dame Quickly's piqued hat and green apron, somewhat
overcharged in the features. But I appeal to my own contem<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_19" id="vol_i_Page_19">[Pg&nbsp;19]</a></span>poraries, who
have known wheel-road, bridle-way, and footpath, for thirty years,
whether they do not, every one of them, remember Meg Dods&mdash;or somebody
very like her. Indeed, so much is this the case, that, about the period
I mention, I should have been afraid to have rambled from the Scottish
metropolis, in almost any direction, lest I had lighted upon some one of
the sisterhood of Dame Quickly, who might suspect me of having showed
her up to the public in the character of Meg Dods. At present, though it
is possible that some one or two of this peculiar class of wild-cats may
still exist, their talons must be much impaired by age; and I think they
can do little more than sit, like the Giant Pope, in the Pilgrim's
Progress, at the door of their unfrequented caverns, and grin at the
pilgrims over whom they used formerly to execute their despotism.<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_20" id="vol_i_Page_20">[Pg&nbsp;20]</a></span></p>

<p>It was on a fine summer's day that a solitary traveller rode under the
old-fashioned archway, and alighted in the court-yard of Meg Dods's inn,
and delivered the bridle of his horse to the humpbacked postilion.
&ldquo;Bring my saddle-bags,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;into the house&mdash;or stay&mdash;I am abler, I
think, to carry them than you.&rdquo; He then assisted the poor meagre groom
to unbuckle the straps which secured the humble and now despised
convenience, and meantime gave strict charges that his horse should be
unbridled, and put into a clean and comfortable stall, the girths
slacked, and a cloth cast over his loins; but that the saddle should not
be removed until he himself came to see him dressed.</p>

<p>The companion of his travels seemed in the hostler's eye deserving of
his care, being a strong active horse, fit either for the road or field,
but rather high in bone from a long journey, though from the state of
his skin it appeared the utmost care had been bestowed to keep him in
condition. While the groom obeyed the stranger's directions, the latter,
with the saddle-bags laid over his arm, entered the kitchen of the inn.<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_21" id="vol_i_Page_21">[Pg&nbsp;21]</a></span></p>

<p>Here he found the landlady herself in none of her most blessed humours.
The cook-maid was abroad on some errand, and Meg, in a close review of
the kitchen apparatus, was making the unpleasant discovery, that
trenchers had been broken or cracked, pots and saucepans not so
accurately scoured as her precise notions of cleanliness required,
which, joined to other detections of a more petty description, stirred
her bile in no small degree; so that while she disarranged and arranged
the <i>bink</i>, she maundered, in an under tone, complaints and menaces
against the absent delinquent.</p>

<p>The entrance of a guest did not induce her to suspend this agreeable
amusement&mdash;she just glanced at him as he entered, then turned her back
short on him, and continued her labour and her soliloquy of lamentation.
Truth is, she thought she recognised in the person of the stranger, one
of those useful envoys of the commercial community, called, by
themselves and the waiters, <i>Travellers</i>, par excellence&mdash;by others,
Riders and Bagmen. Now against this class of customers Meg had peculiar
prejudices; because, there being no shops in the old village of Saint
Ronan's, the said commercial emissaries, for the convenience of their
traffic, always took up their abode at the New Inn, or Hotel, in the
rising and rival village called Saint Ronan's Well, unless when some
straggler, by chance or dire necessity, was compelled to lodge himself
at the Auld Town, as the place of Meg's residence began to be generally
termed. She had, therefore, no sooner formed the hasty conclusion, that
the individual in question belonged to this obnoxious class, than she
resumed her former occupation, and continued to soliloquize and
apostrophize her absent<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_22" id="vol_i_Page_22">[Pg&nbsp;22]</a></span> handmaidens, without even appearing sensible of
his presence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The huzzy Beenie&mdash;the jaud Eppie&mdash;the deil's buckie of a
callant!&mdash;Another plate gane&mdash;they'll break me out of house and ha'!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The traveller, who, with his saddle-bags rested on the back of a chair,
had waited in silence for some note of welcome, now saw that, ghost or
no ghost, he must speak first, if he intended to have any notice from
his landlady.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are my old acquaintance, Mrs. Margaret Dods?&rdquo; said the stranger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What for no?&mdash;and wha are ye that speers?&rdquo; said Meg, in the same
breath, and began to rub a brass candlestick with more vehemence than
before&mdash;the dry tone in which she spoke, indicating plainly how little
concern she took in the conversation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A traveller, good Mistress Dods, who comes to take up his lodgings here
for a day or two.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am thinking ye will be mista'en,&rdquo; said Meg; &ldquo;there's nae room for
bags or jaugs here&mdash;ye've mista'en your road, neighbour&mdash;ye maun e'en
bundle yoursell a bit farther down hill.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see you have not got the letter I sent you, Mistress Dods?&rdquo; said the
guest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How should I, man?&rdquo; answered the hostess; &ldquo;they have ta'en awa the
post-office from us&mdash;moved it down till the Spa-well yonder, as they
ca'd.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, that is but a step off,&rdquo; observed the guest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye will get there the sooner,&rdquo; answered the hostess.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, but,&rdquo; said the guest, &ldquo;if you had sent there for my letter, you
would have learned&rdquo;&mdash;<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_23" id="vol_i_Page_23">[Pg&nbsp;23]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'm no wanting to learn ony thing at my years,&rdquo; said Meg. &ldquo;If folk have
ony thing to write to me about, they may gie the letter to John Hislop,
the carrier, that has used the road these forty years. As for the
letters at the post-mistress's, as they ca' her, down by yonder, they
may bide in her shop-window, wi' the snaps and bawbee rows, till
Beltane, or I loose them. I'll never file my fingers with them.
Post-mistress, indeed!&mdash;Upsetting cutty! I mind her fu' weel when she
dree'd penance for ante-nup&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Laughing, but interrupting Meg in good time for the character of the
post-mistress, the stranger assured her he had sent his fishing-rod and
trunk to her confidential friend the carrier, and that he sincerely
hoped she would not turn an old acquaintance out of her premises,
especially as he believed he could not sleep in a bed within five miles
of Saint Ronan's, if he knew that her Blue room was unengaged.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fishing-rod!&mdash;Auld acquaintance!&mdash;Blue room!&rdquo; echoed Meg, in some
surprise; and, facing round upon the stranger, and examining him with
some interest and curiosity,&mdash;&ldquo;Ye'll be nae bagman, then, after a'?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the traveller; &ldquo;not since I have laid the saddle-bags out of
my hand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Weel, I canna say but I am glad of that&mdash;I canna bide their yanking way
of knapping English at every word.&mdash;I have kent decent lads amang them
too&mdash;What for no?&mdash;But that was when they stopped up here whiles, like
other douce folk; but since they gaed d<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_24" id="vol_i_Page_24">[Pg&nbsp;24]</a></span>own, the hail flight of them,
like a string of wild-geese, to the new-fashioned hottle yonder, I am
told there are as mony hellicate tricks played in the travellers' room,
as they behove to call it, as if it were fu' of drunken young lairds.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is because they have not you to keep good order among them,
Mistress Margaret.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, lad?&rdquo; replied Meg, &ldquo;ye are a fine blaw-in-my-lug, to think to
cuittle me off sae cleverly!&rdquo; And, facing about upon her guest, she
honoured him with a more close and curious investigation than she had at
first designed to bestow upon him.</p>

<p>All that she remarked was in her opinion rather favourable to the
stranger. He was a well-made man, rather above than under the middle
size, and apparently betwixt five-and-twenty and thirty years of
age&mdash;for, although he might, at first glance, have passed for one who
had attained the latter period, yet, on a nearer examination, it seemed
as if the burning sun of a warmer climate than Scotland, and perhaps
some fatigue, both of body and mind, had imprinted the marks of care and
of manhood upon his countenance, without abiding the course of years.
His eyes and teeth were excellent, and his other features, though they
could scarce be termed handsome, expressed sense and acuteness; he bore,
in his aspect, that ease and composure of manner, equally void of
awkwardness and affectation, which is said emphatically to mark the
gentleman; and, although neither the plainness of his dress, nor the
total want of the usual attendants, allowed Meg to suppose him a wealthy
man, she had little doubt that he was above the rank of her lodgers in
general. Amidst these observations, and while she was in the course of
making them, the good landlady was embarrassed wi<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_25" id="vol_i_Page_25">[Pg&nbsp;25]</a></span>th various obscure
recollections of having seen the object of them formerly; but when, or
on what occasion, she was quite unable to call to remembrance. She was
particularly puzzled by the cold and sarcastic expression of a
countenance, which she could not by any means reconcile with the
recollections which it awakened. At length she said, with as much
courtesy as she was capable of assuming,&mdash;&ldquo;Either I have seen you
before, sir, or some ane very like ye?&mdash;Ye ken the Blue room, too, and
you a stranger in these parts?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not so much a stranger as you may suppose, Meg,&rdquo; said the guest,
assuming a more intimate tone, &ldquo;when I call myself Frank Tyrrel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tirl!&rdquo; exclaimed Meg, with a tone of wonder&mdash;&ldquo;It's impossible! You
cannot be Francie Tirl, the wild callant that was fishing and
bird-nesting here seven or eight years syne&mdash;it canna be&mdash;Francie was
but a callant!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But add seven or eight years to that boy's life, Meg,&rdquo; said the
stranger gravely, &ldquo;and you will find you have the man who is now before
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Even sae!&rdquo; said Meg, with a glance at the reflection of her own
countenance in the copper coffee-pot, which she had scoured so brightly
that it did the office of a mirror&mdash;&ldquo;Just e'en sae&mdash;but folk maun grow
auld or die.&mdash;But, Maister Tirl, for I mauna ca' ye Francie now, I am
thinking&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Call me what you please, good dame,&rdquo; said the stranger; &ldquo;it has been so
long since I heard any one call me by a name that sounded like former
kindness, that such a one is more agreeable to me than a lord's title
would be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Weel, then, Maister Francie&mdash;if it be no offence to you&mdash;I hope ye are
no a Nabob?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not I, I can safely assure you, my old f<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_26" id="vol_i_Page_26">[Pg&nbsp;26]</a></span>riend;&mdash;but what an I were?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Naething&mdash;only maybe I might bid ye gang farther, and be waur
served.&mdash;Nabobs, indeed! the country's plagued wi' them. They have
raised the price of eggs and pootry for twenty miles round&mdash;But what is
my business?&mdash;They use amaist a' of them the Well down by&mdash;they need it,
ye ken, for the clearing of their copper complexions, that need scouring
as much as my saucepans, that naebody can clean but mysell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, my good friend,&rdquo; said Tyrrel, &ldquo;the upshot of all this is, I hope,
that I am to stay and have dinner here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What for no?&rdquo; replied Mrs. Dods.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And that I am to have the Blue room for a night or two&mdash;perhaps
longer?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I dinna ken that,&rdquo; said the dame.&mdash;&ldquo;The Blue room is the best&mdash;and they
that get neist best, are no ill aff in this warld.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Arrange it as you will,&rdquo; said the stranger, &ldquo;I leave the whole matter
to you, mistress.&mdash;Meantime, I will go see after my horse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The merciful man,&rdquo; said Meg, when her guest had left the kitchen, &ldquo;is
merciful to his beast.&mdash;He had aye something about him by ordinar, that
callant&mdash;But eh, sirs! there is a sair change on his cheek-haffit since
I saw him last!&mdash;He sall no want a good dinner for auld lang syne, that
I'se engage for.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Meg set about the necessary preparations with all the natural energy of
her disposition, which was so much exerted upon her culinary cares, that
her two maids, on their return to the house, escaped the bitter
reprimand which she had been previously conning ov<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_27" id="vol_i_Page_27">[Pg&nbsp;27]</a></span>er, in reward for
their alleged slatternly negligence. Nay, so far did she carry her
complaisance, that when Tyrrel crossed the kitchen to recover his
saddle-bags, she formally rebuked Eppie for an idle taupie, for not
carrying the gentleman's things to his room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thank you, mistress,&rdquo; said Tyrrel; &ldquo;but I have some drawings and
colours in these saddle-bags, and I always like to carry them myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, and are you at the painting trade yet?&rdquo; said Meg; &ldquo;an unco slaister
ye used to make with it lang syne.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot live without it,&rdquo; said Tyrrel; and taking the saddle-bags, was
formally inducted by the maid into a snug apartment, where he soon had
the satisfaction to behold a capital dish of minced collops, with
vegetables, and a jug of excellent ale, placed on the table by the
careful hand of Meg herself. He could do no less, in acknowledgment of
the honour, than ask Meg for a bottle of the yellow seal, &ldquo;if there was
any of that excellent claret still left.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Left?&mdash;ay is there, walth of it,&rdquo; said Meg; &ldquo;I dinna gie it to every
body&mdash;Ah! Maister Tirl, ye have not got ower your auld tricks!&mdash;I am
sure, if ye are painting for your leeving, as you say, a little rum and
water would come cheaper, and do ye as much good. But ye maun hae your
ain way the day, nae doubt, if ye should never have it again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Away trudged Meg, her keys clattering as she went, and, after much
rummaging, returned with such a bottle of claret as no fashionable
tavern could have produced, were it called for by a duke, or at a duke's
price; and she seemed not a little gratified whe<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_28" id="vol_i_Page_28">[Pg&nbsp;28]</a></span>n her guest assured her
that he had not yet forgotten its excellent flavour. She retired after
these acts of hospitality, and left the stranger to enjoy in quiet the
excellent matters which she had placed before him.</p>

<p>But there was that on Tyrrel's mind which defied the enlivening power of
good cheer and of wine, which only maketh man's heart glad when that
heart has no secret oppression to counteract its influence. Tyrrel found
himself on a spot which he had loved in that delightful season, when
youth and high spirits awaken all those flattering promises which are so
ill kept to manhood. He drew his chair into the embrasure of the
old-fashioned window, and throwing up the sash to enjoy the fresh air,
suffered his thoughts to return to former days, while his eyes wandered
over objects which they had not looked upon for several eventful years.
He could behold beneath his eye, the lower part of the decayed village,
as its ruins peeped from the umbrageous shelter with which they were
shrouded. Still lower down, upon the little holm which formed its
church-yard, was seen the Kirk of Saint Ronan's; and looking yet
farther, towards the junction of Saint Ronan's burn with the river which
traversed the larger dale or valley, he could see whitened, by the
western sun, the rising houses, which were either newly finished, or in
the act of being built, about the medicinal spring.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Time changes all around us,&rdquo; such was the course of natural though
trite reflection, which flowed upon Tyrrel's mind; &ldquo;wherefore should
loves and friendships have a longer date than our dwellings and our
monuments?&rdquo; As he indulged these sombre recollections, his officious
landlady disturbed their tenor by her entrance.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_29" id="vol_i_Page_29">[Pg&nbsp;29]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I was thinking to offer you a dish of tea, Maister Francie, just for
the sake of auld lang syne, and I'll gar the quean Beenie bring it
here, and mask it mysell.&mdash;But ye arena done with your wine yet?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am indeed, Mrs. Dods,&rdquo; answered Tyrrel; &ldquo;and I beg you will remove
the bottle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Remove the bottle, and the wine no half drank out!&rdquo; said Meg,
displeasure lowering on her brow; &ldquo;I hope there is nae fault to be found
wi' the wine, Maister Tirl?&rdquo;</p>

<p>To this answer, which was put in a tone resembling defiance, Tyrrel
submissively replied, by declaring &ldquo;the claret not only unexceptionable,
but excellent.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what for dinna ye drink it, then?&rdquo; said Meg, sharply; &ldquo;folk should
never ask for mair liquor than they can make a gude use of. Maybe ye
think we have the fashion of the table-dot, as they ca' their newfangled
ordinary down-by yonder, where a' the bits of vinegar cruets are put awa
into an awmry, as they tell me, and ilk ane wi' the bit dribbles of
syndings in it, and a paper about the neck o't, to show which of the
customers is aught it&mdash;there they stand like doctor's drogs&mdash;and no an
honest Scottish mutchkin will ane o' their viols haud, granting it were
at the fouest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; said Tyrrel, willing to indulge the spleen and prejudice of
his old acquaintance, &ldquo;perhaps the wine is not so good as to make full
measure desirable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye may say that, lad&mdash;and yet them that sell it might afford a gude
penniworth, for they hae it for the making&mdash;maist feck of it ne'er saw
France or Portugal. But a<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_30" id="vol_i_Page_30">[Pg&nbsp;30]</a></span>s I was saying&mdash;this is no ane of their
newfangled places, where wine is put by for them that canna drink
it&mdash;when the cork's drawn the bottle maun be drank out&mdash;and what for
no?&mdash;unless it be corkit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I agree entirely, Meg,&rdquo; said her guest; &ldquo;but my ride to-day has
somewhat heated me&mdash;and I think the dish of tea you promise me, will do
me more good than to finish my bottle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Na, then, the best I can do for you is to put it by, to be sauce for
the wild-duck the morn; for I think ye said ye were to bide here for a
day or twa.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is my very purpose, Meg, unquestionably,&rdquo; replied Tyrrel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sae be it then,&rdquo; said Mrs. Dods; &ldquo;and then the liquor's no lost&mdash;it has
been seldom sic claret as that has simmered in a saucepan, let me tell
you that, neighbour;&mdash;and I mind the day, when, headache or nae
headache, ye wad hae been at the hinder-end of that bottle, and maybe
anither, if ye could have gotten it wiled out of me. But then ye had
your cousin to help you&mdash;Ah! he was a blithe bairn that Valentine
Bulmer!&mdash;Ye were a canty callant too, Maister Francie, and muckle ado I
had to keep ye baith in order when ye were on the ramble. But ye were a
thought doucer than Valentine&mdash;But O! he was a bonny laddie!&mdash;wi' e'en
like diamonds, cheeks like roses, a head like a heather-tap&mdash;he was the
first I ever saw wear a crap, as they ca' it, but a' body cheats the
barber now&mdash;and he had a laugh that wad hae raised the dead!&mdash;What wi'
flyting on him, and what wi' laughing at him, there was nae minding ony
other body when that Valentine was in the house.&mdash;And how is your cousin
Valentine Bulmer, Maister Francie?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tyrrel looked down, and only answered wi<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_31" id="vol_i_Page_31">[Pg&nbsp;31]</a></span>th a sigh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay&mdash;and is it even sae?&rdquo; said Meg; &ldquo;and has the puir bairn been sae
soon removed frae this fashious warld?&mdash;Ay&mdash;ay&mdash;we maun a' gang ae
gate&mdash;crackit quart stoups and geisen'd barrels&mdash;leaky quaighs are we
a', and canna keep in the liquor of life&mdash;Ohon, sirs!&mdash;Was the puir lad
Bulmer frae Bu'mer bay, where they land the Hollands, think ye, Maister
Francie?&mdash;They whiles rin in a pickle tea there too&mdash;I hope that is good
that I have made you, Maister Francie?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Excellent, my good dame,&rdquo; said Tyrrel; but it was in a tone of voice
which intimated that she had pressed upon a subject that awakened some
unpleasant reflections.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And when did this puir lad die?&rdquo; continued Meg, who was not without her
share of Eve's qualities, and wished to know something concerning what
seemed to affect her guest so particularly; but he disappointed her
purpose, and at the same time awakened another train of sentiment in her
mind, by turning again to the window, and looking upon the distant
buildings of Saint Ronan's Well. As if he had observed for the first
time these new objects, he said to Mistress Dods in an indifferent tone,
&ldquo;You have got some gay new neighbours yonder, mistress.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Neighbours!&rdquo; said Meg, her wrath beginning to arise, as it always did
upon any allusion to this sore subject&mdash;&ldquo;Ye may ca' them neighbours, if
ye like&mdash;but the deil flee awa wi' the neighbourhood for Meg Dods!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; said Tyrrel, as if he did not observe her displeasure,
&ldquo;that yonder is the Fox Hotel they told me of?&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_32" id="vol_i_Page_32">[Pg&nbsp;32]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;The Fox!&rdquo; said Meg: &ldquo;I am sure it is the fox that has carried off a' my
geese.&mdash;I might shut up house, Maister Francie, if it was the thing I
lived by&mdash;me, that has seen a' our gentlefolk bairns, and gien them
snaps and sugar-biscuit maist of them wi' my ain hand! They wad hae seen
my father's roof-tree fa' down and smoor me before they wad hae gien a
boddle a-piece to have propped it up&mdash;but they could a' link out their
fifty pounds ower head to bigg a hottle at the Well yonder. And muckle
they hae made o't&mdash;the bankrupt body, Sandie Lawson, hasna paid them a
bawbee of four terms' rent.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Surely, mistress, I think if the Well became so famous for its cures,
the least the gentlemen could have done was to make you the priestess.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Me priestess! I am nae Quaker, I wot, Maister Francie; and I never
heard of alewife that turned preacher, except Luckie Buchan in the
west.<a name="vol_i_FNanchor_8_8" id="vol_i_FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#vol_i_Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> And if I were to preach, I think I have mair the spirit of a
Scottishwoman, than to preach in the very room they hae been dancing in
ilka night in the week, Saturday itsell not excepted, and that till twal
o'clock at night. Na, na, Maister Francie; I leave the like o' that to
Mr. Simon Chatterly, as they ca' the bit prelatical sprig of divinity
from the town yonder, that plays at cards, and dances six days in the
week, and on the seventh reads the Common Prayer-book in the ball-room,
with Tam Simson, the drunken barber, for his clerk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I have heard of Mr. Chatterly,&rdquo; said Tyr<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_33" id="vol_i_Page_33">[Pg&nbsp;33]</a></span>rel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye'll be thinking o' the sermon he has printed,&rdquo; said the angry dame,
&ldquo;where he compares their nasty puddle of a Well yonder to the pool of
Bethseda, like a foul-mouthed, fleeching, feather-headed fule as he is!
He should hae kend that the place got a' its fame in the times of black
Popery; and though they pat it in St. Ronan's name, I'll never believe
for one that the honest man had ony hand in it; for I hae been tell'd by
ane that suld ken, that he was nae Roman, but only a Cuddie, or
Culdee,<a name="vol_i_FNanchor_C_26" id="vol_i_FNanchor_C_26"></a><a href="#vol_i_Footnote_C_26" class="fnanchor">[C]</a> or such like.&mdash;But will ye not take anither dish of tea,
Maister Francie? and a wee bit of the diet-loaf, raised wi' my ain fresh
butter, Maister Francie? and no wi' greasy kitchen-fee, like the
seedcake down at the confectioner's yonder, that has as mony dead flees
as carvy in it. Set him up for a confectioner!&mdash;Wi' a penniworth of
rye-meal, and anither of tryacle, and twa or three carvy-seeds, I will
make better confections than ever cam out of his oven.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have no doubt of that, Mrs. Dods,&rdquo; said the guest; &ldquo;and I only wish
to know how these new comers were able to establish themselves against a
house of such good reputation and old standing as yours?&mdash;It was the
virtues of the mineral, I dare say; but how came the waters to recover a
character all at once, mistress?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I dinna ken, sir&mdash;they used to be thought good for naething, but here
and there for a puir body's bairn, that had gotten the cruells,<a name="vol_i_FNanchor_9_9" id="vol_i_FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#vol_i_Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> and
could not afford a penniworth of salts. But my Leddy Penelope Penfea<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_34" id="vol_i_Page_34">[Pg&nbsp;34]</a></span>ther
had fa'an ill, it's like, as nae other body ever fell ill, and sae she
was to be cured some gate naebody was ever cured, which was naething
mair than was reasonable&mdash;and my leddy, ye ken, has wit at wull, and has
a' the wise folk out from Edinburgh at her house at Windywa's yonder,
which it is her leddyship's wull and pleasure to call Air-castle&mdash;and
they have a' their different turns, and some can clink verses, wi' their
tale, as weel as Rob Burns or Allan Ramsay&mdash;and some rin up hill and
down dale, knapping the chucky stanes to pieces wi' hammers, like sae
mony road-makers run daft&mdash;they say it is to see how the warld was
made!&mdash;and some that play on all manner of ten-stringed instruments&mdash;and
a wheen sketching souls, that ye may see perched like craws on every
craig in the country, e'en working at your ain trade, Maister Francie;
forby men that had been in foreign parts, or said they had been there,
whilk is a' ane, ye ken; and maybe twa or three draggletailed misses,
that wear my Leddy Penelope's follies when she has dune wi' them, as her
queans of maids wear her second-hand claithes. So, after her leddyship's
happy recovery, as they ca'd it, down cam the hail tribe of wild-geese,
and settled by the Well, to dine thereout on the bare grund, like a
wheen tinklers; and they had sangs, and tunes, and healths, nae doubt,
in praise of the fountain, as they ca'd the Well, and of Leddy Penelope
Penfeather; and, lastly, they behoved a' to take a solemn bumper of the
spring, which, as I'm tauld, made unco havoc amang them or they wan
hame; and this they ca'd picknick, and a plague to them! And sae the jig
was begun after her leddyship's pipe, and mony a mad measure has been
danced sin' syne; for down cam masons<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_35" id="vol_i_Page_35">[Pg&nbsp;35]</a></span> and murgeon-makers, and preachers
and player-folk, and Episcopalians and Methodists, and fools and
fiddlers, and Papists and pie-bakers, and doctors and drugsters; by the
shop-folk, that sell trash and trumpery at three prices&mdash;and so up got
the bonny new Well, and down fell the honest auld town of Saint Ronan's,
where blithe decent folk had been heartsome eneugh for mony a day before
ony o' them were born, or ony sic vapouring fancies kittled in their
cracked brains.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What said your landlord, the Laird of Saint Ronan's, to all this?&rdquo; said
Tyrrel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is't <i>my</i> landlord ye are asking after, Maister Francie?&mdash;the Laird of
Saint Ronan's is nae landlord of mine, and I think ye might hae minded
that.&mdash;Na, na, thanks be to Praise! Meg Dods is baith land<i>lord</i> and
land<i>leddy</i>. Ill eneugh to keep the doors open as it is, let be facing
Whitsunday and Martinmas&mdash;an auld leather pock there is, Maister
Francie, in ane of worthy Maister Bindloose the sheriff-clerk's
pigeon-holes, in his dowcot of a closet in the burgh; and therein is
baith charter and sasine, and special service to boot; and that will be
chapter and verse, speer when ye list.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had quite forgotten,&rdquo; said Tyrrel, &ldquo;that the inn was your own; though
I remember you were a considerable landed proprietor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe I am,&rdquo; replied Meg, &ldquo;maybe I am not: and if I be, what for
no?&mdash;But as to what the Laird, whose grandfather was my father's
landlord, said to the new doings yonder&mdash;he just jumped at the ready
penny, like a cock at a grosert, and feu'd the bonny holm beside the
Well, that they ca'd the Saint-Well-holm, that was like the best land in
his aught, to be carved, and biggit, and howkit up,<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_36" id="vol_i_Page_36">[Pg&nbsp;36]</a></span> just at the pleasure
of Jock Ashler the stane-mason, that ca's himsell an arkiteck&mdash;there's
nae living for new words in this new warld neither, and that is another
vex to auld folk such as me.&mdash;It's a shame o' the young Laird, to let
his auld patrimony gang the gate it's like to gang, and my heart is sair
to see't, though it has but little cause to care what comes of him or
his.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it the same Mr. Mowbray,&rdquo; said Mr. Tyrrel, &ldquo;who still holds the
estate?&mdash;the old gentleman, you know, whom I had some dispute with&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;About hunting moorfowl upon the Spring-well-head muirs?&rdquo; said Meg. &ldquo;Ah,
lad! honest Mr. Bindloose brought you neatly off there&mdash;Na, it's no that
honest man, but his son John Mowbray&mdash;the t'other has slept down-by in
Saint Ronan's Kirk for these six or seven years.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did he leave,&rdquo; asked Tyrrel, with something of a faltering voice, &ldquo;no
other child than the present Laird?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No other son,&rdquo; said Meg; &ldquo;and there's e'en eneugh, unless he could have
left a better ane.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He died then,&rdquo; said Tyrrel, &ldquo;excepting this son, without children?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By your leave, no,&rdquo; said Meg; &ldquo;there is the lassie Miss Clara, that
keeps house for the Laird, if it can be ca'd keeping house, for he is
almost aye down at the Well yonder&mdash;so a sma' kitchen serves them at the
Shaws.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Clara will have but a dull time of it there during her brother's
absence?&rdquo; said the stranger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Out no!&mdash;he has her aften jinketing about, and back and forward, wi' a'
the fine flichtering fools that come yonder; and clapping palms wi'
them, and linking at their dances and daffings. I wuss nae <span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_37" id="vol_i_Page_37">[Pg&nbsp;37]</a></span>ill come o't,
but it's a shame her father's daughter should keep company wi' a' that
scauff and raff of physic-students, and writers' prentices, and bagmen,
and siclike trash as are down at the Well yonder.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are severe, Mrs. Dods,&rdquo; replied the guest. &ldquo;No doubt Miss Clara's
conduct deserves all sort of freedom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am saying naething against her conduct,&rdquo; said the dame; &ldquo;and there's
nae ground to say onything that I ken of&mdash;But I wad hae like draw to
like, Maister Francie. I never quarrelled the ball that the gentry used
to hae at my bit house a gude wheen years bygane&mdash;when they came, the
auld folk in their coaches, wi' lang-tailed black horses, and a wheen
galliard gallants on their hunting horses, and mony a decent leddy
behind her ain goodman, and mony a bonny smirking lassie on her pownie,
and wha sae happy as they&mdash;And what for no? And then there was the
farmers' ball, wi' the tight lads of yeomen with the bran new blues and
the buckskins&mdash;These were decent meetings&mdash;but then they were a' ae
man's bairns that were at them, ilk ane kend ilk other&mdash;they danced
farmers wi' farmers' daughters, at the tane, and gentles wi' gentle
blood, at the t'other, unless maybe when some of the gentlemen of the
Killnakelty Club would gie me a round of the floor mysell, in the way of
daffing and fun, and me no able to flyte on them for laughing&mdash;I am sure
I never grudged these innocent pleasures, although it has cost me maybe
a week's redding up, before I got the better of the confusion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, dame,&rdquo; said Tyrrel, &ldquo;this ceremonial would be a little hard upon
strangers like myself, for how were we to find partners in these family
parties of yours?&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_38" id="vol_i_Page_38">[Pg&nbsp;38]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Never you fash your thumb about that, Maister Francie,&rdquo; returned the
landlady, with a knowing wink.&mdash;&ldquo;Every Jack will find a Jill, gang the
world as it may&mdash;and, at the warst o't, better hae some fashery in
finding a partner for the night, than get yoked with ane that you may
not be able to shake off the morn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And does that sometimes happen?&rdquo; asked the stranger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Happen!&mdash;and is't amang the Well folk that ye mean?&rdquo; exclaimed the
hostess. &ldquo;Was it not the last season, as they ca't, no farther gane,
that young Sir Bingo Binks, the English lad wi' the red coat, that keeps
a mail-coach, and drives it himsell, gat cleekit with Miss Rachel
Bonnyrigg, the auld Leddy Loupengirth's lang-legged daughter&mdash;and they
danced sae lang thegither, that there was mair said than suld hae been
said about it&mdash;and the lad would fain hae louped back, but the auld
leddy held him to his tackle, and the Commissary Court and somebody else
made her Leddy Binks in spite of Sir Bingo's heart&mdash;and he has never
daured take her to his friends in England, but they have just wintered
and summered it at the Well ever since&mdash;and that is what the Well is
good for!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And does Clara,&mdash;I mean does Miss Mowbray, keep company with such women
as these?&rdquo; said Tyrrel, with a tone of interest which he checked as he
proceeded with the question.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What can she do, puir thing?&rdquo; said the dame. &ldquo;She maun keep the company
that her brother keeps, for she is clearly dependent.&mdash;But<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_39" id="vol_i_Page_39">[Pg&nbsp;39]</a></span>, speaking of
that, I ken what I have to do, and that is no little, before it darkens.
I have sat clavering with you ower lang, Maister Francie.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And away she marched with a resolved step, and soon the clear octaves of
her voice were heard in shrill admonition to her handmaidens.</p>

<p>Tyrrel paused a moment in deep thought, then took his hat, paid a visit
to the stable, where his horse saluted him with feathering ears, and
that low amicable neigh, with which that animal acknowledges the
approach of a loving and beloved friend. Having seen that the faithful
creature was in every respect attended to, Tyrrel availed himself of the
continued and lingering twilight, to visit the old Castle, which, upon
former occasions, had been his favourite evening walk. He remained while
the light permitted, admiring the prospect we attempted to describe in
the first chapter, and comparing, as in his former reverie, the faded
hues of the glimmering landscape to those of human life, when early
youth and hope have ceased to gild them.</p>

<p>A brisk walk to the inn, and a light supper on a Welsh rabbit and the
dame's home-brewed, were stimulants of livelier, at least mor<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_40" id="vol_i_Page_40">[Pg&nbsp;40]</a></span>e resigned
thoughts&mdash;and the Blue bedroom, to the honours of which he had been
promoted, received him a contented, if not a cheerful tenant.</p>

<i>The Album of St. Ronan's.</i><br />
</p>


<p>Francis Tyrrel was, in the course of the next day, formally settled in
his old quarters, where he announced his purpose of remaining for
several days. The old-established carrier of the place brought his
fishing-rod and travelling-trunk, with a letter to Meg, dated a week
previously, desiring her to prepare to receive an old acquaintance. This
annunciation, though something of the latest, Meg received with great
complacency, observing it was a civil attention in Maister Tirl; and
that John Hislop, though he was not just sae fast, was far surer than
ony post of them a', or express either. She also observed with
satisfaction, that there was no gun-case along with her guest's baggage;
&ldquo;for that weary gunning had brought him and her into trouble&mdash;the lairds
had cried out upon't, as if she made her house a howff for common
fowlers and poachers; <span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_41" id="vol_i_Page_41">[Pg&nbsp;41]</a></span>and yet how could she hinder twa daft hempie
callants from taking a start and an ower-loup?<a name="vol_i_FNanchor_10_10" id="vol_i_FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#vol_i_Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> They had been ower
the neighbour's ground they had leave on up to the march, and they
werena just to ken meiths when the moorfowl got up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In a day or two, her guest fell into such quiet and solitary habits,
that Meg, herself the most restless and bustling of human creatures,
began to be vexed, for want of the trouble which she expected to have
had with him, experiencing, perhaps, the same sort of feeling from his
extreme and passive indifference on all points, that a good horseman has
for the over-patient steed, which he can scarce feel under him. His
walks were devoted to the most solitary recesses among the neighbouring
woods and hills&mdash;his fishing-rod was often left behind him, or carried
merely as an apology for sauntering slowly by the banks of some little
brooklet&mdash;and his success so indifferent, that Meg said the piper of
Peebles<a name="vol_i_FNanchor_11_11" id="vol_i_FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#vol_i_Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> would have caught a creelfu' before Maister Francie made out
the half-dozen; so that he was obliged, for peace's sake, to vindicate
his character, by killing a handsome salmon.</p>

<p>Tyrrel's painting, as Meg called it, went on equally slowly: He often,
indeed, showed her the sketches which he brought from his walks, and
used to finish at home; but Meg held them very cheap. What signified,
she said, a wheen bits of paper, wi' black and white scarts upon them,
that he ca'd bushes, and trees, and craigs?&mdash;Couldna he paint them wi'
green, and blue, and yellow, like the other folk? &ldquo;Ye will never mak
your bread that way, Maister Francie. Ye suld munt up a muckle square of
canvass, like Dick Tinto, and paint folks ainsells, that they like<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_42" id="vol_i_Page_42">[Pg&nbsp;42]</a></span>
muckle better to see than ony craig in the haill water; and I wadna
muckle objeck even to some of the Wallers coming up and sitting to ye.
They waste their time waur, I wis&mdash;and, I warrant, ye might make a
guinea a-head of them. Dick made twa, but he was an auld used hand, and
folk maun creep before they gang.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In answer to these remonstrances, Tyrrel assured her, that the sketches
with which he busied himself were held of such considerable value, that
very often an artist in that line received much higher remuneration for
these, than for portraits or coloured drawings. He added, that they were
often taken for the purpose of illustrating popular poems, and hinted as
if he himself were engaged in some labour of that nature.</p>

<p>Eagerly did Meg long to pour forth to Nelly Trotter, the
fishwoman,&mdash;whose cart formed the only neutral channel of communication
between the Auld Town and the Well, and who was in favour with Meg,
because, as Nelly passed her door in her way to the Well, she always had
the first choice of her fish,&mdash;the merits of her lodger as an artist.
Luckie Dods had, in truth, been so much annoyed and bullied, as it were,
with the report of clever persons, accomplished in all sorts of
excellence, arriving day after day at the Hotel, that she was overjoyed
in this fortunate opportunity to triumph over them in their own way; and
it may be believed, that the excellences of her lodger lost nothing by
being trumpeted through her mouth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I maun hae the best of the cart, Nelly&mdash;if you and me can gree&mdash;for it
is for ane of the best of painters. Your fine folk down yonder would gie
their lugs to look at what he has been doing&mdash;he gets gowd in<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_43" id="vol_i_Page_43">[Pg&nbsp;43]</a></span> goupins,
for three downright skarts and three cross anes&mdash;And he is no an
ungrateful loon, like Dick Tinto, that had nae sooner my good
five-and-twenty shillings in his pocket, than he gaed down to birl it
awa at their bonny hottle yonder, but a decent quiet lad, that kens when
he is weel aff, and bides still at the auld howff&mdash;And what for
no?&mdash;Tell them all this, and hear what they will say till't.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed, mistress, I can tell ye that already, without stirring my
shanks for the matter,&rdquo; answered Nelly Trotter; &ldquo;they will e'en say that
ye are ae auld fule, and me anither, that may hae some judgment in
cock-bree or in scate-rumples, but mauna fash our beards about ony thing
else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wad they say sae, the frontless villains! and me been a housekeeper
this thirty year!&rdquo; exclaimed Meg; &ldquo;I wadna hae them say it to my face!
But I am no speaking without warrant&mdash;for what an I had spoken to the
minister, lass, and shown him ane of the loose skarts of paper that
Maister Tirl leaves fleeing about his room?&mdash;and what an he had said he
had kend Lord Bidmore gie five guineas for the waur on't? and a' the
warld kens he was lang tutor in the Bidmore family.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Troth,&rdquo; answered her gossip, &ldquo;I doubt if I was to tell a' this they
would hardly believe me, mistress; for there are sae mony judges amang
them, and they think sae muckle of themsells, and sae little of other
folk, that unless ye were to send down the bit picture, I am no thinking
they will believe a word that I can tell them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No believe what an honest woman says&mdash;let abee to say twa o' them?&rdquo;
exclaimed Meg; &ldquo;O the unbelievi<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_44" id="vol_i_Page_44">[Pg&nbsp;44]</a></span>ng generation!&mdash;Weel, Nelly, since my
back is up, ye sall tak down the picture, or sketching, or whatever it
is, (though I thought sketchers<a name="vol_i_FNanchor_12_12" id="vol_i_FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#vol_i_Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> were aye made of airn,) and shame
wi' it the conceited crew that they are.&mdash;But see and bring't back wi'
ye again, Nelly, for it's a thing of value; and trustna it out o' your
hand, <i>that</i> I charge you, for I lippen no muckle to their
honesty.&mdash;And, Nelly, ye may tell them he has an illustrated
poem&mdash;<i>illustrated</i>&mdash;mind the word, Nelly&mdash;that is to be stuck as fou o'
the like o' that, as ever turkey was larded wi' dabs o' bacon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus furnished with her credentials, and acting the part of a herald
betwixt two hostile countries, honest Nelly switched her little
fish-cart downwards to St. Ronan's Well.</p>

<p>In watering-places, as in other congregated assemblies of the human
species, various kinds of government have been dictated, by chance,
caprice, or convenience; but in almost all of them, some sort of
direction has been adopted, to prevent the consequences of anarchy.
Sometimes the sole power has been vested in a Master of Ceremonies; but
this, like other despotisms, has been of late unfashionable, and the
powers of this great officer have been much limited even at Bath, where
Nash once ruled with undisputed supremacy. Committees of management,
chosen from among the most steady guests, have been in general resorted
to, as a more liberal mode of sway, and to such was confided the
administration of the infant republic of St. Ronan's Well. This little
senate, it must be observed, had the more difficult task in discharging
their high duties, that, like those of other republics, their subjects
were divided into two jarring and contending fac<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_45" id="vol_i_Page_45">[Pg&nbsp;45]</a></span>tions, who every day
eat, drank, danced, and made merry together, hating each other all the
while with all the animosity of political party, endeavouring by every
art to secure the adherence of each guest who arrived, and ridiculing
the absurdities and follies of each other, with all the wit and
bitterness of which they were masters.</p>

<p>At the head of one of these parties was no less a personage than Lady
Penelope Penfeather, to whom the establishment owed its fame, nay, its
existence; and whose influence could only have been balanced by that of
the Lord of the Manor, Mr. Mowbray of St. Ronan's, or, as he was called
usually by the company who affected what Meg called knapping English,
The Squire, who was leader of the opposite faction.</p>

<p>The rank and fortune of the lady, her pretensions to beauty as well as
talent, (though the former was something faded,) and the consequence
which she arrogated to herself as a woman of fashion, drew round her
painters and poets, and philosophers, and men of science, and lecturers,
and foreign adventurers, <i>et hoc genus omne</i>.</p>

<p>On the contrary, the Squire's influence, as a man of family and property
in the immediate neighbourhood, who actually kept greyhounds and
pointers, and at least talked of hunters and of racers, ascertained him
the support of the whole class of bucks, half and whole bred, from the
three next counties; and if more inducements were wanting, he could
grant his favourites the privilege of shooting over his moors, which is
enough to turn the head of a young Scottishman at any time. Mr. Mowbray
was of late especially supported in his pre-eminence, by a close
alliance with Sir Bingo Binks, a sapient English<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_46" id="vol_i_Page_46">[Pg&nbsp;46]</a></span> Baronet, who, ashamed,
as many thought, to return to his own country, had set him down at the
Well of St. Ronan's, to enjoy the blessing which the Caledonian Hymen
had so kindly forced on him in the person of Miss Rachel Bonnyrigg. As
this gentleman actually drove a regular-built mail-coach, not in any
respect differing from that of his Majesty, only that it was more
frequently overturned, his influence with a certain set was
irresistible, and the Squire of St. Ronan's, having the better sense of
the two, contrived to reap the full benefit of the consequence attached
to his friendship.</p>

<p>These two contending parties were so equally balanced, that the
predominance of the influence of either was often determined by the
course of the sun. Thus, in the morning and forenoon, when Lady Penelope
led forth her herd to lawn and shady bower, whether to visit some ruined
monument of ancient times, or eat their pic-nic luncheon, to spoil good
paper with bad drawings, and good verses with repetition&mdash;in a word,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;To rave, recite, and madden round the land,&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>her ladyship's empire over the loungers seemed uncontrolled and
absolute, and all things were engaged in the <i>tourbillon</i>, of which she
formed the pivot and centre. Even the hunters, and shooters, and hard
drinkers, were sometimes fain reluctantly to follow in her train,
sulking, and quizzing, and flouting at her solemn festivals, besides
encouraging the younger nymphs to giggle when they should have looked
sentimental. But after dinner the scene was changed, and her ladyship's
sweetest smiles, and softest invitations, were often insufficient to
draw the neutral part of the company to the tea-room; so<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_47" id="vol_i_Page_47">[Pg&nbsp;47]</a></span> that her
society was reduced to those whose constitution or finances rendered
early retirement from the dining-parlour a matter of convenience,
together with the more devoted and zealous of her own immediate
dependents and adherents. Even the faith of the latter was apt to be
debauched. Her ladyship's poet-laureate, in whose behalf she was teazing
each new-comer for subscriptions, got sufficiently independent to sing
in her ladyship's presence, at supper, a song of rather equivocal
meaning; and her chief painter, who was employed upon an illustrated
copy of the Loves of the Plants, was, at another time, seduced into such
a state of pot-valour, that, upon her ladyship's administering her usual
dose of criticism upon his works, he not only bluntly disputed her
judgment, but talked something of his right to be treated like a
gentleman.</p>

<p>These feuds were taken up by the Managing Committee, who interceded for
the penitent offenders on the following morning, and obtained their
re-establishment in Lady Penelope's good graces, upon moderate terms.
Many other acts of moderating authority they performed, much to the
assuaging of faction, and the quiet of the Wellers; and so essential was
their government to the prosperity of the place, that, without them, St.
Ronan's spring would probably have been speedily deserted. We must,
therefore, give a brief sketch of that potential Committee, which both
factions, acting as if on a self-denying ordinance, had combined to
invest with the reins of government.</p>

<p>Each of its members appeared to be selected, as Fortunio, in the
fairy-tale,<a name="vol_i_FNanchor_D_27" id="vol_i_FNanchor_D_27"></a><a href="#vol_i_Footnote_D_27" class="fnanchor">[D]</a> chose his followers, for his peculiar gifts. First on the
list stood the <span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_48" id="vol_i_Page_48">[Pg&nbsp;48]</a></span><span class="smcap">Man of Medicine</span>, Dr. Quentin Quackleben, who claimed
right to regulate medical matters at the spring, upon the principle
which, of old, assigned the property of a newly discovered country to
the bucanier who committed the earliest piracy on its shores. The
acknowledgment of the Doctor's merit as having been first to proclaim
and vindicate the merits of these healing fountains, had occasioned his
being universally installed First Physician and Man of Science, which
last qualification he could apply to all purposes, from the boiling of
an egg to the giving a lecture. He was, indeed, qualified, like many of
his profession, to spread both the bane and antidote before a dyspeptic
patient, being as knowing a gastronome as Dr. Redgill himself, or any
other worthy physician who has written for the benefit of the <i>cuisine</i>,
from Dr. Moncrieff of Tippermalloch, to the late Dr. Hunter of York, and
the present Dr. Kitchiner of London. But pluralities are always
invidious, and therefore the Doctor prudently relinquished the office of
caterer and head-carver to the Man of Taste, who occupied regularly, and
<i>ex officio</i>, the head of the table, reserving to himself the occasional
privilege of criticising, and a principal share in consuming, the good
things which the common entertainment afforded. We have only to sum up
this brief account of the learned Doctor, by informing the reader that
he was a tall, lean, beetle-browed man, with an ill-made black
scratch-wig, that stared out on either side from his lantern jaws. He
resided nine months out of the twelve at St. Ronan's, and was supposed
to make an indifferent good thing of it,&mdash;especially as he played whist
to admiration.</p>

<p>First in place, though perhaps second to the Doct<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_49" id="vol_i_Page_49">[Pg&nbsp;49]</a></span>or in real authority,
was Mr. Winterblossom; a civil sort of person, who was nicely precise in
his address, wore his hair cued, and dressed with powder, had
knee-buckles set with Bristol stones, and a seal-ring as large as Sir
John Falstaff's. In his heyday he had a small estate, which he had spent
like a gentleman, by mixing with the gay world. He was, in short, one of
those respectable links that connect the coxcombs of the present day
with those of the last age, and could compare, in his own experience,
the follies of both. In latter days, he had sense enough to extricate
himself from his course of dissipation, though with impaired health and
impoverished fortune.</p>

<p>Mr. Winterblossom now lived upon a moderate annuity, and had discovered
a way of reconciling his economy with much company and made dishes, by
acting as perpetual president of the table-d'hote at the Well. Here he
used to amuse the society by telling stories about Garrick, Foote,
Bonnel Thornton, and Lord Kelly, and delivering his opinions in matters
of taste and vertu. An excellent carver, he knew how to help each guest
to what was precisely his due; and never failed to reserve a proper
slice as the reward of his own labours. To conclude, he was possessed of
some taste in the fine arts, at least in painting and music, although it
was rather of the technical kind, than that which warms the heart and
elevates the feelings. There was, indeed, about Winterblossom, nothing
that was either warm or elevated. He was shrewd, selfish, and sensual;
the last two of which qualities he screened from observation, under a
specious varnish of exterior complaisance. Therefore, in his professed
and apparent anxiety to do the honours of the table, to th<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_50" id="vol_i_Page_50">[Pg&nbsp;50]</a></span>e most
punctilious point of good breeding, he never permitted the attendants
upon the public taste to supply the wants of others, until all his own
private comforts had been fully arranged and provided for.</p>

<p>Mr. Winterblossom was also distinguished for possessing a few curious
engravings, and other specimens of art, with the exhibition of which he
occasionally beguiled a wet morning at the public room. They were
collected, &ldquo;<i>viis et modis</i>,&rdquo; said the Man of Law, another distinguished
member of the Committee, with a knowing cock of his eye to his next
neighbour.</p>

<p>Of this person little need be said. He was a large-boned, loud-voiced,
red-faced man, named Meiklewham; a country writer, or attorney, who
managed the matters of the Squire much to the profit of one or
other,&mdash;if not of both. His nose projected from the front of his broad
vulgar face, like the stile of an old sun-dial, twisted all of one side.
He was as great a bully in his profession, as if it had been military
instead of civil: conducted the whole technicalities concerning the
cutting up the Saint's-Well-haugh, so much lamented by Dame Dods, into
building-stances, and was on excellent terms with Doctor Quackleben, who
always recommended him to make the wills of his patients.</p>

<p>After the Man of Law comes Captain Mungo MacTurk, a Highland lieutenant
on half-pay, and that of ancient standing; one who preferred toddy of
the strongest to wine, and in that fashion and cold drams finished about
a bottle of whisky <i>per diem</i>, whenever he could come by it. He was
called the Man of Peace, on the same principle which assigns to
constables, Bow-street runners, and such like, who carry bludgeo<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_51" id="vol_i_Page_51">[Pg&nbsp;51]</a></span>ns to
break folk's heads, and are perpetually and officially employed in
scenes of riot, the title of peace-officers&mdash;that is, because by his
valour he compelled others to act with discretion. The Captain was the
general referee in all those abortive quarrels, which, at a place of
this kind, are so apt to occur at night, and to be quietly settled in
the morning; and occasionally adopted a quarrel himself, by way of
taking down any guest who was unusually pugnacious. This occupation
procured Captain MacTurk a good deal of respect at the Well; for he was
precisely that sort of person who is ready to fight with any one,&mdash;whom
no one can find an apology for declining to fight with,&mdash;in fighting
with whom considerable danger was incurred, for he was ever and anon
showing that he could snuff a candle with a pistol ball,&mdash;and lastly,
through fighting with whom no eclat or credit could redound to the
antagonist. He always wore a blue coat and red collar, had a
supercilious taciturnity of manner, ate sliced leeks with his cheese,
and resembled in complexion a Dutch red-herring.</p>

<p>Still remains to be mentioned the Man of Religion&mdash;the gentle Mr. Simon
Chatterly, who had strayed to St. Ronan's Well from the banks of Cam or
Isis, and who piqued himself, first on his Greek, and secondly, on his
politeness to the ladies. During all the week days, as Dame Dods has
already hinted, this reverend gentleman was the partner at the
whist-table, or in the ball-room, to what maid or matron soever lacked a
partner at either; and on the Sundays, he read prayers in the public
room to all who chose to attend. He was also a deviser of charades, and
an unriddler of riddles; he played a little on the flute, and was Mr.
Winterblossom's principal a<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_52" id="vol_i_Page_52">[Pg&nbsp;52]</a></span>ssistant in contriving those ingenious and
romantic paths, by which, as by the zig-zags which connect military
parallels, you were enabled to ascend to the top of the hill behind the
hotel, which commands so beautiful a prospect, at exactly that precise
angle of ascent, which entitles a gentleman to offer his arm, and a lady
to accept it, with perfect propriety.</p>

<p>There was yet another member of this Select Committee, Mr. Michael
Meredith, who might be termed the Man of Mirth, or, if you please, the
Jack Pudding to the company, whose business it was to crack the best
joke, and sing the best song,&mdash;he could. Unluckily, however, this
functionary was for the present obliged to absent himself from St.
Ronan's; for, not recollecting that he did not actually wear the
privileged motley of his profession, he had passed some jest upon
Captain MacTurk, which cut so much to the quick, that Mr. Meredith was
fain to go to goat-whey quarters, at some ten miles' distance, and
remain there in a sort of concealment, until the affair should be made
up through the mediation of his brethren of the Committee.</p>

<p>Such were the honest gentlemen who managed the affairs of this rising
settlement, with as much impartiality as could be expected. They were
not indeed without their own secret predilections; for the lawyer and
the soldier privately inclined to the party of the Squire, while the
parson, Mr. Meredith, and Mr. Winterblossom, were more devoted to the
interests of Lady Penelope; so that Doctor Quackleben alone, who
probably recollected that the gentlemen were as liable to stomach
complaints, as the ladies to nervous disorders, seemed the only person<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_53" id="vol_i_Page_53">[Pg&nbsp;53]</a></span>
who preserved in word and deed the most rigid neutrality. Nevertheless,
the interests of the establishment being very much at the heart of this
honourable council, and each feeling his own profit, pleasure, or
comfort, in some degree involved, they suffered not their private<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_54" id="vol_i_Page_54">[Pg&nbsp;54]</a></span>
affections to interfere with their public duties, but acted, every one
in his own sphere, for the public benefit of the whole community.</p>

<p>The clamour which attends the removal of dinner from a public room had
subsided; the clatter of plates, and knives and forks&mdash;the bustling
tread of awkward boobies of country servants, kicking each other's
shins, and wrangling, as they endeavour to rush out of the door three
abreast&mdash;the clash of glasses and tumblers, borne to earth in the
tumult&mdash;the shrieks of the landlady&mdash;the curses, not loud, but deep, of
the landlord&mdash;had all passed away; and those of the company who had
servants, had been accommodated by their respective Ganymedes with such
remnants of their respective bottles of wine, spirits, &amp;c., as the said
Ganymedes had not previously consumed, while the rest, broken in to such
observance by Mr. Winterblossom, waited patiently until the worthy
president's own special and multifarious commissions had been executed
by a tidy young woman and a lumpish lad, the regular attendants
belonging to the house, but whom he permitted to wait on no one, till,
as the hymn says,</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_55" id="vol_i_Page_55">[Pg&nbsp;55]</a></span></p><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;All his wants were well supplied.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>&ldquo;And, Dinah&mdash;my bottle of pale sherry, Dinah&mdash;place it on this
side&mdash;there's a good girl;&mdash;and, Toby&mdash;get my jug with the hot
water&mdash;and let it be boiling&mdash;and don't spill it on Lady Penelope, if
you can help it, Toby.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;for her ladyship has been in hot water to-day already,&rdquo; said the
Squire; a sarcasm to which Lady Penelope only replied with a look of
contempt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And, Dinah, bring the sugar&mdash;the soft East India sugar, Dinah&mdash;and a
lemon, Dinah, one of those which came fresh to-day&mdash;Go fetch it from the
bar, Toby&mdash;and don't tumble down stairs, if you can help it.&mdash;And,
Dinah&mdash;stay, Dinah&mdash;the nutmeg, Dinah, and the ginger, my good
girl&mdash;And, Dinah&mdash;put the cushion up behind my back&mdash;and the footstool
to my foot, for my toe is something the worse of my walk with your
ladyship this morning to the top of Belvidere.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Her ladyship may call it what she pleases in common parlance,&rdquo; said the
writer; &ldquo;but it must stand Munt-grunzie in the stamped paper, being so
nominated in the ancient writs and evidents thereof.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And, Dinah,&rdquo; continued the president, &ldquo;lift up my handkerchief&mdash;and&mdash;a
bit of biscuit, Dinah&mdash;and&mdash;and I do not think I want any thing
else&mdash;Look to the company, my good girl.&mdash;I have the honour to drink the
company's very good health&mdash;Will your ladyship honour me by accepting a
glass of negus?&mdash;I learned to make negus from old Dartineuf's son.&mdash;He
always used East India sugar and added a tama<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_56" id="vol_i_Page_56">[Pg&nbsp;56]</a></span>rind&mdash;it improves the
flavour infinitely.&mdash;Dinah, see your father sends for some
tamarinds&mdash;Dartineuf knew a good thing almost as well as his father&mdash;I
met him at Bath in the year&mdash;let me see&mdash;Garrick was just taking leave,
and that was in,&rdquo; &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.&mdash;&ldquo;And what is this now, Dinah?&rdquo; he said,
as she put into his hand a roll of paper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Something that Nelly Trotter&rdquo; (Trotting Nelly, as the company called
her) &ldquo;brought from a sketching gentleman that lives at the woman's&rdquo;
(thus bluntly did the upstart minx describe the reverend Mrs. Margaret
Dods) &ldquo;at the Cleikum of Aultoun yonder&rdquo;&mdash;A name, by the way, which the
inn had acquired from the use which the saint upon the sign-post was
making of his pastoral crook.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed, Dinah?&rdquo; said Mr. Winterblossom, gravely taking out his
spectacles, and wiping them before he opened the roll of paper; &ldquo;some
boy's daubing, I suppose, whose pa and ma wish to get him into the
Trustees' School, and so are beating about for a little interest.&mdash;But I
am drained dry&mdash;I put three lads in last season; and if it had not been
my particular interest with the secretary, who asks my opinion now and
then, I could not have managed it. But giff-gaff, say I.&mdash;Eh! What, in
the devil's name, is this?&mdash;Here is both force and keeping&mdash;Who can this
be, my lady?&mdash;Do but see the sky-line&mdash;why, this is really a little
bit&mdash;an exquisite little bit&mdash;Who the devil can it be? and how can he
have stumbled upon the dog-hole in the Old Town, and the snarling b&mdash;&mdash;I
beg your ladyship ten thousand pardons&mdash;that kennels there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I dare say, my lady,&rdquo; said a little miss of fourteen, <span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_57" id="vol_i_Page_57">[Pg&nbsp;57]</a></span>her eyes growing
rounder and rounder, and her cheeks redder and redder, as she found
herself speaking, and so many folks listening&mdash;&ldquo;O la! I dare say it is
the same gentleman we met one day in the Low-wood walk, that looked like
a gentleman, and yet was none of the company, and that you said was a
handsome man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did not say handsome, Maria,&rdquo; replied her ladyship; &ldquo;ladies never say
men are handsome&mdash;I only said he looked genteel and interesting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And that, my lady,&rdquo; said the young parson, bowing and smiling, &ldquo;is, I
will be judged by the company, the more flattering compliment of the
two&mdash;We shall be jealous of this Unknown presently.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, but,&rdquo; continued the sweetly communicative Maria, with some real
and some assumed simplicity, &ldquo;your ladyship forgets&mdash;for you said
presently after, you were sure he was no gentleman, for he did not run
after you with your glove which you had dropped&mdash;and so I went back
myself to find your ladyship's glove, and he never offered to help me,
and I saw him closer than your ladyship did, and I am sure he is
handsome, though he is not very civil.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You speak a little too much and too loud, miss,&rdquo; said Lady Penelope, a
natural blush reinforcing the <i>nuance</i> of rouge by which it was usually
superseded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What say you to that, Squire Mowbray?&rdquo; said the elegant Sir Bingo
Binks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A fair challenge to the field, Sir Bingo,&rdquo; answered the squire; &ldquo;when a
lady throws down the gauntlet, a gentleman may throw the handkerchief.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have always the benefit of <i>your</i> best construc<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_58" id="vol_i_Page_58">[Pg&nbsp;58]</a></span>tion, Mr. Mowbray,&rdquo;
said the lady, with dignity. &ldquo;I suppose Miss Maria has contrived this
pretty story for your amusement. I can hardly answer to Mr. Digges, for
bringing her into company where she receives encouragement to behave
so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, nay, my lady,&rdquo; said the president, &ldquo;you must let the jest pass by;
and since this is really such an admirable sketch, you must honour us
with your opinion, whether the company can consistently with propriety
make any advances to this man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In my opinion,&rdquo; said her ladyship, the angry spot still glowing on her
brow, &ldquo;there are enough of <i>men</i> among us already&mdash;I wish I could say
gentlemen&mdash;As matters stand, I see little business <i>ladies</i> can have at
St. Ronan's.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was an intimation which always brought the Squire back to
good-breeding, which he could make use of when he pleased. He deprecated
her ladyship's displeasure, until she told him, in returning good
humour, that she really would not trust him unless he brought his sister
to be security for his future politeness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Clara, my lady,&rdquo; said Mowbray, &ldquo;is a little wilful; and I believe your
ladyship must take the task of unharbouring her into your own hands.
What say you to a gipsy party up to my old shop?&mdash;It is a bachelor's
house&mdash;you must not expect things in much order; but Clara would be
honoured&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>The Lady Penelope eagerly accepted the proposal of something like a
party, and, quite reconciled with Mowbray, began to enquire whether she
might bring the stranger artist with her; &ldquo;that is,&rdquo; said her ladyship,
looking to Dinah, &ldquo;if he be a gentleman.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_59" id="vol_i_Page_59">[Pg&nbsp;59]</a></span></p>
<p>Here Dinah interposed her assurance, &ldquo;that the gentleman at Meg Dods's
was quite and clean a gentleman, and an illustrated poet besides.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;An illustrated poet, Dinah?&rdquo; said Lady Penelope; &ldquo;you must mean an
illustrious poet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I dare to say your ladyship is right,&rdquo; said Dinah, dropping a curtsy.</p>

<p>A joyous flutter of impatient anxiety was instantly excited through all
the blue-stocking faction of the company, nor were the news totally
indifferent to the rest of the community. The former belonged to that
class, who, like the young Ascanius, are ever beating about in quest of
a tawny lion, though they are much more successful in now and then
starting a great bore;<a name="vol_i_FNanchor_13_13" id="vol_i_FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#vol_i_Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> and the others, having left all their own
ordinary affairs and subjects of interest at home, were glad to make a
matter of importance of the most trivial occurrence. A mighty poet, said
the former class&mdash;who could it possibly be?&mdash;All names were recited&mdash;all
Britain scrutinized, from Highland hills to the Lakes of
Cumberland&mdash;from Sydenham Common to St. James's Place&mdash;even the Banks of
the Bosphorus were explored for some name which might rank under this
distinguished epithet.&mdash;And then, besides his illustrious poesy, to
sketch so inimitably!&mdash;who <i>could</i> it be? And all the gapers, who had
nothing of their own to suggest, answered with the antistrophe, &ldquo;Who
could it be?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Claret-Club, which comprised the choicest and firmest adherents of
Squire Mowbray and the Barone<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_60" id="vol_i_Page_60">[Pg&nbsp;60]</a></span>t&mdash;men who scorned that the reversion of
one bottle of wine should furnish forth the feast of to-morrow, though
caring nought about either of the fine arts in question, found out an
interest of their own, which centred in the same individual.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say, little Sir Bingo,&rdquo; said the Squire, &ldquo;this is the very fellow
that we saw down at the Willow-slack on Saturday&mdash;he was tog'd
gnostically enough, and cast twelve yards of line with one hand&mdash;the fly
fell like a thistledown on the water.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Uich!&rdquo; answered the party he addressed, in the accents of a dog choking
in the collar.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We saw him pull out the salmon yonder,&rdquo; said Mowbray; &ldquo;you
remember&mdash;clean fish&mdash;the tide-ticks on his gills&mdash;weighed, I dare say,
a matter of eighteen pounds.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sixteen!&rdquo; replied Sir Bingo, in the same tone of strangulation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;None of your rigs, Bing!&rdquo; said his companion, &ldquo;&mdash;nearer eighteen than
sixteen!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nearer sixteen, by &mdash;&mdash;!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you go a dozen of blue on it to the company?&rdquo; said the Squire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, d&mdash;&mdash; me!&rdquo; croaked the Baronet&mdash;&ldquo;to our own set I will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then, I say done!&rdquo; quoth the Squire.</p>

<p>And &ldquo;Done!&rdquo; responded the Knight; and out came their red pocketbooks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But who shall decide the bet?&rdquo; said the Squire, &ldquo;The genius himself, I
suppose; they talk of asking him here, but I suppose he will scarce mind
quizzes like them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Write myself&mdash;John Mowbray,&rdquo; said the Baronet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You, Baronet!&mdash;you write!&rdquo; answered the Squire, &ldquo;d&mdash;&mdash; me, that cock
won't fight&mdash;you won't.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_61" id="vol_i_Page_61">[Pg&nbsp;61]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; growled Sir Bingo, more articulately than usual.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, you can't!&rdquo; said Mowbray. &ldquo;You never wrote a line in your life,
save those you were whipped for at school.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can write&mdash;I will write!&rdquo; said Sir Bingo. &ldquo;Two to one I will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And there the affair rested, for the council of the company were in high
consultation concerning the most proper manner of opening a
communication with the mysterious stranger; and the voice of Mr.
Winterblossom, whose tones, originally fine, age had reduced to
falsetto, was calling upon the whole party for &ldquo;Order, order!&rdquo; So that
the bucks were obliged to lounge in silence, with both arms reclined on
the table, and testifying, by coughs and yawns, their indifference to
the matters in question, while the rest of the company debated upon
them, as if they were matters of life and death.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A visit from one of the gentlemen&mdash;Mr. Winterblossom, if he would take
the trouble&mdash;in name of the company at large&mdash;would, Lady Penelope
Penfeather presumed to think, be a necessary preliminary to an
invitation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Winterblossom was &ldquo;quite of her ladyship's opinion, and would gladly
have been the personal representative of the company at St. Ronan's
Well&mdash;but it was up hill&mdash;her ladyship knew his tyrant, the gout, was
hovering upon the frontiers&mdash;there were other gentlemen, younger and
more worthy to fly at the lady's command than an ancient Vulcan like
him&mdash;there was the valiant Mars and the eloquent Mercury.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus speaking, he bowed to Captain MacTurk and the Rev. Mr. Simon<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_62" id="vol_i_Page_62">[Pg&nbsp;62]</a></span>
Chatterly, and reclined on his chair, sipping his negus with the
self-satisfied smile of one, who, by a pretty speech, has rid himself
of a troublesome commission. At the same time, by an act probably of
mental absence, he put in his pocket the drawing, which, after
circulating around the table, had returned back to the chair of the
president, being the point from which it had set out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By Cot, madam,&rdquo; said Captain MacTurk, &ldquo;I should be proud to obey your
leddyship's commands&mdash;but, by Cot, I never call first on any man that
never called upon me at all, unless it were to carry him a friend's
message, or such like.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Twig the old connoisseur,&rdquo; said the Squire to the Knight.&mdash;&ldquo;He is
condiddling the drawing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go it, Johnnie Mowbray&mdash;pour it into him,&rdquo; whispered Sir Bingo.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank ye for nothing, Sir Bingo,&rdquo; said the Squire, in the same tone.
&ldquo;Winterblossom is one of us&mdash;<i>was</i> one of us at least&mdash;and won't stand
the ironing. He has his Wogdens still, that were right things in his
day, and can hit the hay-stack with the best of us&mdash;but stay, they are
hallooing on the parson.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They were indeed busied on all hands, to obtain Mr. Chatterly's consent
to wait on the Genius unknown; but though he smiled and simpered, and
was absolutely incapable of saying No, he begged leave, in all humility,
to decline that commission. &ldquo;The truth was,&rdquo; he pleaded in his excuse,
&ldquo;that having one day walked to visit the old Castle of St. Ronan's, and
returning through the Auld Town, as it was popularly called, he had
stopped at the door of the <i>Cleikum</i>,&rdquo; (pronounced <i>Anglic&eacute;</i>,<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_63" id="vol_i_Page_63">[Pg&nbsp;63]</a></span> with the
open diphthong,) &ldquo;in hopes to get a glass of syrup of capillaire, or a
draught of something cooling; and had in fact expressed his wishes, and
was knocking pretty loudly, when a sash-window was thrown suddenly up,
and ere he was aware what was about to happen, he was soused with a
deluge of water,&rdquo; (as he said,) &ldquo;while the voice of an old hag from
within assured him, that if that did not cool him there was another
biding him,&mdash;an intimation which induced him to retreat in all haste
from the repetition of the shower-bath.&rdquo;</p>

<p>All laughed at the account of the chaplain's misfortune, the history of
which seemed to be wrung from him reluctantly, by the necessity of
assigning some weighty cause for declining to execute the ladies'
commands. But the Squire and Baronet continued their mirth far longer
than decorum allowed, flinging themselves back in their chairs, with
their hands thrust into their side-pockets, and their mouths expanded
with unrestrained enjoyment, until the sufferer, angry, disconcerted,
and endeavouring to look scornful, incurred another general burst of
laughter on all hands.</p>

<p>When Mr. Winterblossom had succeeded in restoring some degree of order,
he found the mishaps of the young divine proved as intimidating as
ludicrous. Not one of the company chose to go Envoy Extraordinary to the
dominions of Queen Meg, who might be suspected of paying little respect
to the sanctity of an ambassador's person. And what was worse, when it
was resolved that a civil card from Mr. Winterblossom, in the name of
the company, should be sent to the stranger, instead of a personal
visit, Dinah informed them that s<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_64" id="vol_i_Page_64">[Pg&nbsp;64]</a></span>he was sure no one about the house
could be bribed to carry up a letter of the kind; for, when such an
event had taken place two summers since, Meg, who construed it into an
attempt to seduce from her tenement the invited guest, had so handled a
ploughboy who carried the letter, that he fled the country-side
altogether, and never thought himself safe till he was at a village ten
miles off, where it was afterwards learned he enlisted with a recruiting
party, choosing rather to face the French than to return within the
sphere of Meg's displeasure.</p>

<p>Just while they were agitating this new difficulty, a prodigious clamour
was heard without, which, to the first apprehensions of the company,
seemed to be Meg, in all her terrors, come to anticipate the proposed
invasion. Upon enquiry, however, it proved to be her gossip, Trotting
Nelly, or Nelly Trotter, in the act of forcing her way up stairs,
against the united strength of the whole household of the hotel, to
reclaim Luckie Dods's picture, as she called it. This made the
connoisseur's treasure tremble in his pocket, who, thrusting a
half-crown into Toby's hand, exhorted him to give it her, and try his
influence in keeping her back. Toby, who knew Nelly's nature, put the
half-crown into his own pocket, and snatched up a gill-stoup of whisky
from the sideboard. Thus armed, he boldly confronted the virago, and
interposing a <i>remora</i>, which was able to check poor Nelly's course in
her most determined moods, not only succeeded in averting the immediate
storm which approached the company in general, and Mr. Winterblossom in
particular, but brought the guests the satisfactory informatio<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_65" id="vol_i_Page_65">[Pg&nbsp;65]</a></span>n, that
Trotting Nelly had agreed, after she had slept out her nap in the barn,
to convey their commands to the Unknown of Cleikum of Aultoun.</p>

<p>Mr. Winterblossom, therefore, having authenticated his proceedings, by
inserting in the Minutes of the Committee, the authority which he had
received, wrote his card in the best style of diplomacy, and sealed it
with the seal of the Spa, which bore something like a nymph, seated
beside what was designed to represent an urn.</p>

<p>The rival factions, however, did not trust entirely to this official
invitation. Lady Penelope was of opinion that they should find some way
of letting the stranger&mdash;a man of talent unquestionably&mdash;understand that
there were in the society to which he was invited, spirits of a more
select sort, who felt worthy to intrude themselves on his solitude.</p>

<p>Accordingly, her ladyship imposed upon the elegant Mr. Chatterly the
task of expressing the desire of the company to see the unknown artist,
in a neat occasional copy of verses. The poor gentleman's muse, however,
proved unpropitious; for he was able to proceed no farther than two
lines in half an hour, which, coupled with its variations, we insert
from the blotted manuscript, as Dr. Johnson has printed the alterations
in Pope's version of the Iliad:</p>



<div class='center'>

<p>The eloquence of a prose billet was necessarily resorted<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_66" id="vol_i_Page_66">[Pg&nbsp;66]</a></span> to in the
absence of the heavenly muse, and the said billet was secretly intrusted
to the care of Trotting Nelly. The same trusty emissary, when refreshed
by her nap among the pease-straw, and about to harness her cart for her
return to the seacoast, (in the course of which she was to pass the
Aultoun,) received another card, written, as he had threatened, by Sir
Bingo Binks himself, who had given himself this trouble to secure the
settlement of the bet; conjecturing that a man with a fashionable
exterior, who could throw twelve yards of line at a cast with such
precision, might consider the invitation of Winterblossom as that of an
old twaddler, and care as little for the good graces of an affected
blue-stocking and her <i>c&ocirc;terie</i>, whose conversation, in Sir Bingo's
mind, relished of nothing but of weak tea and bread and butt<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_67" id="vol_i_Page_67">[Pg&nbsp;67]</a></span>er. Thus the
happy Mr. Francis Tyrrel received, considerably to his surprise, no less
than three invitations at once from the Well of St. Ronan's.</p>

<h3>EPISTOLARY ELOQUENCE.</h3>

</div></div>

<p class="citation">

</p>


<p>Desirous of authenticating our more important facts, by as many original
documents as possible, we have, after much research, enabled ourselves
to present the reader with the following accurate transcripts of the
notes intrusted to the care of Trotting Nelly. The first ran thus:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;Mr. Winterblossom [of Silverhed] has the commands of Lady Penelope
Penfeather, Sir Bingo and Lady Binks, Mr. and Miss Mowbray [of St.
Ronan's], and the rest of the company at the Hotel and Tontine Inn
of St. Ronan's Well, to express their hope that the gentleman
lodged at the Cleikum Inn, Old Town of St. Ronan's, will favour
them with his company at the Ordinary, as early and as often as may
suit his convenience. The <span class="smcap">Company</span> think it necessary to send this
intimation, because, according to the <span class="smcap">Rules</span> of the place, the
Ordinary can only be attended by such gentlemen and ladies as lodge
at St. Ronan's Well; but they are happy to make a distinction in
favour of a gentleman so distinguished for success in the fine arts
as Mr. &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash;,<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_68" id="vol_i_Page_68">[Pg&nbsp;68]</a></span> residing at Cleikum. If Mr. &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash; should be
inclined, upon becoming further acquainted with the <span class="smcap">Company</span> and
<span class="smcap">Rules</span> of the Place, to remove his residence to the Well, Mr.
Winterblossom, though he would not be understood to commit himself
by a positive assurance to that effect, is inclined to hope that an
arrangement might be made, notwithstanding the extreme crowd of the
season, to accommodate Mr. &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash; at the lodging-house, called
Lilliput-Hall. It will much conduce to facilitate this negotiation,
if Mr. &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash; would have the goodness to send an exact note of
his stature, as Captain Rannletree seems disposed to resign the
folding-bed at Lilliput-Hall, on account of his finding it rather
deficient in length. Mr. Winterblossom begs farther to assure Mr.
&mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash; of the esteem in which he holds his genius, and of his
high personal consideration.</p>

<p style="text-align: right;">
&ldquo;For &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash;, Esquire,<br />
Cleikum Inn, Old Town of St. Ronan's.<br /></p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&ldquo;<i>The Public Rooms,</i><br /></span>
<i>Hotel and Tontine, St. Ronan's Well,</i><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>&amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</i>&rdquo;<br /></span>
</p>
</div>

<p>The above card was written (we love to be precise in matters concerning
orthography) in a neat, round, clerk-like hand, which, like Mr.
Winterblossom's character, in many particulars was most accurate and
commonplace, though betraying an affectation both of flourish and of
facility.</p>

<p>The next billet was a contrast to the diplomatic gravity and accuracy of
Mr. Winterblossom's official communication, and ran thus, the young
divine's academic jests and classical flowers of eloquence being mingled
with some wild flowers from the teeming fancy of Lady Penelope.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_69" id="vol_i_Page_69">[Pg&nbsp;69]</a></span></p><div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;A choir of Dryads and Naiads, assembled at the healing spring of
St. Ronan's, have learned with surprise that a youth, gifted by
Apollo, when the Deity was prodigal, with two of his most esteemed
endowments, wanders at will among their domains, frequenting grove
and river, without once dreaming of paying homage to its tutelary
deities. He is, therefore, summoned to their presence, and prompt
obedience will insure him forgiveness; but in case of contumacy,
let him beware how he again essays either the lyre or the pallet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Postscript.</i> The adorable Penelope, long enrolled among the
Goddesses for her beauty and virtues, gives Nectar and Ambrosia,
which mortals call tea and cake, at the Public Rooms, near the
Sacred Spring, on Thursday evening, at eight o'clock, when the
Muses never fail to attend. The stranger's presence is requested to
participate in the delights of the evening.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Second Postscript.</i> A shepherd, ambitiously aiming at more
accommodation than his narrow cot affords, leaves it in a day or
two.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Assuredly the thing is to be hired.&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 12em;"><i>As You Like It.</i><br /></span>
</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Postscript third.</i> Our Iris, whom mortals know as Trotting Nelly
in her tartan cloak, will bring us the stranger's answer to our
celestial summons.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>This letter was written in a delicate Italian hand, garnished with fine
hair-strokes and dashes, which were sometimes so dexterously thrown off
as to represent lyres, pallets, vases, and other appropriate
decorations, suited to the tenor of the contents.</p>

<p>The third epistle was a complete contrast to the other two. It was
written in a coarse, irregular, schoolboy half-text, which, however,
seemed to h<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_70" id="vol_i_Page_70">[Pg&nbsp;70]</a></span>ave cost the writer as much pains as if it had been a
specimen of the most exquisite caligraphy. And these were the
contents:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Sur</span>&mdash;Jack Moobray has betted with me that the samon you killed on
Saturday last weyd ni to eiteen pounds,&mdash;I say nyer sixteen.&mdash;So
you being a spurtsman, 'tis refer'd.&mdash;So hope you will come or send
me't; do not doubt you will be on honour. The bet is a dozen of
claret, to be drank at the hotel by our own sett, on Monday next;
and we beg you will make one; and Moobray hopes you will come
down.&mdash;Being, sir, your most humbel servant,&mdash;Bingo Binks Baronet,
and of Block-hall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Postscript.</i> Have sent some loops of Indian gout, also some black
hakkels of my groom's dressing; hope they will prove killing, as
suiting river and season.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>No answer was received to any of these invitations for more than three
days; which, while it secretly rather added to than diminished the
curiosity of the Wellers concerning the Unknown, occasioned much railing
in public against him, as ill-mannered and rude.</p>

<p>Meantime, Francis Tyrrel, to his great surprise, began to find, like the
philosophers, that he was never less alone than when alone. In the most
silent and sequestered walks, to which the present state of his mind
induced him to betake himself, he was sure to find some strollers from
the Well, to whom he had become the object of so much solicitous
interest. Quite innocent of the knowledge that he himself possessed the
attraction which occasioned his meeting them so frequently, he began to
doubt whether the Lady Penelope and her maidens&mdash;Mr. Winterblossom and
his grey pony&mdash;the parson and his short black coat and raven-grey
pantaloons&mdash;were not eithe<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_71" id="vol_i_Page_71">[Pg&nbsp;71]</a></span>r actually polygraphic copies of the same
individuals, or possessed of a celerity of motion resembling
omnipresence and ubiquity; for nowhere could he go without meeting
them, and that oftener than once a-day, in the course of his walks.
Sometimes the presence of the sweet Lycoris was intimated by the sweet
prattle in an adjacent shade; sometimes, when Tyrrel thought himself
most solitary, the parson's flute was heard snoring forth Gramachree
Molly; and if he betook himself to the river, he was pretty sure to find
his sport watched by Sir Bingo or some of his friends.</p>

<p>The efforts which Tyrrel made to escape from this persecution, and the
impatience of it which his manner indicated, procured him, among the
Wellers, the name of the <i>Misanthrope</i>; and, once distinguished as an
object of curiosity, he was the person most attended to, who could at
the ordinary of the day give the most accurate account of where the
Misanthrope had been, and how occupied in the course of the morning. And
so far was Tyrrel's shyness from diminishing the desire of the Wellers
for his society, that the latter feeling increased with the difficulty
of gratification,&mdash;as the angler feels the most peculiar interest when
throwing his fly for the most cunning and considerate trout in the pool.</p>

<p>In short, such was the interest which the excited imaginations of the
company took in the Misanthrope, that, notwithstanding the unamiable
qualities which the word expresses, there was only one of the society
who did not desire to see the specimen at their rooms, for the purpose
of examining him closely and at leisure; and the ladies were
particularly desirous to enquire whether he was actually a Misanthrope?
Whether he had been <span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_72" id="vol_i_Page_72">[Pg&nbsp;72]</a></span>always a Misanthrope? What had induced him to become
a Misanthrope? And whether there were no means of inducing him to cease
to be a Misanthrope?</p>

<p>One individual only, as we have said, neither desired to see nor hear
more of the supposed Timon of Cleikum, and that was Mr. Mowbray of St.
Ronan's. Through the medium of that venerable character John Pirner,
professed weaver and practical black-fisher in the Aultoun of St.
Ronan's, who usually attended Tyrrel, to show him the casts of the
river, carry his bag, and so forth, the Squire had ascertained that the
judgment of Sir Bingo regarding the disputed weight of the fish was more
correct than his own. This inferred an immediate loss of honour, besides
the payment of a heavy bill. And the consequences might be yet more
serious; nothing short of the emancipation of Sir Bingo, who had
hitherto been Mowbray's convenient shadow and adherent, but who, if
triumphant, confiding in his superiority of judgment upon so important a
point, might either cut him altogether, or expect that, in future, the
Squire, who had long seemed the planet of their set, should be content
to roll around himself, Sir Bingo, in the capacity of a satellite.</p>

<p>The Squire, therefore, devoutly hoped that Tyrrel's restive disposition
might continue, to prevent the decision of the bet, while, at the same
time, he nourished a very reasonable degree of dislike to that stranger,
who had been the indirect occasion of the unpleasant predicament in
which he found himself, by not catching a salmon weighing a pound
heavier. He, therefore, openly censured the meanness of those who
proposed taking further notice of Tyrrel, and referred to the unanswered
letters, as a piece of impertinence which announced him to be no
gentleman.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_73" id="vol_i_Page_73">[Pg&nbsp;73]</a></span></p>
<p>But though appearances were against him, and though he was in truth
naturally inclined to solitude, and averse to the affectation and
bustle of such a society, that part of Tyrrel's behaviour which
indicated ill-breeding was easily accounted for, by his never having
received the letters which required an answer. Trotting Nelly, whether
unwilling to face her gossip, Meg Dods, without bringing back the
drawing, or whether oblivious through the influence of the double dram
with which she had been indulged at the Well, jumbled off with her cart
to her beloved village of Scate-raw, from which she transmitted the
letters by the first bare-legged gillie who travelled towards Aultoun of
St. Ronan's; so that at last, but after a long delay, they reached the
Cleikum Inn and the hands of Mr. Tyrrel.</p>

<p>The arrival of these documents explained some part of the oddity of
behaviour which had surprised him in his neighbours of the Well; and as
he saw they had got somehow an idea of his being a lion extraordinary,
and was sensible that such is a character equally ridiculous, and
difficult to support, he hastened to write to Mr. Winterblossom a card
in the style of ordinary mortals. In this he stated the delay occasioned
by miscarriage of the letter, and his regret on that account; expressed
his intention of dining with the company at the Well on the succeeding
day, while he regretted that other circumstances, as well as the state
of his health and spirits, would permit him this honour very
infrequently during his stay in the country, and begged no trouble might
be taken about his accommodation at the Well, as he was perfectly
satisfied with his present residence. A separate note to Sir Bingo, said
he was ha<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_74" id="vol_i_Page_74">[Pg&nbsp;74]</a></span>ppy he could verify the weight of the fish, which he had noted
in his diary; (&ldquo;D&mdash;n the fellow, does he keep a diary?&rdquo; said the
Baronet,) and though the result could only be particularly agreeable to
one party, he should wish both winner and loser mirth with their
wine;&mdash;he was sorry he was unable to promise himself the pleasure of
participating in either. Enclosed was a signed note of the weight of the
fish. Armed with this, Sir Bingo claimed his wine&mdash;triumphed in his
judgment&mdash;swore louder and more articulately than ever he was known to
utter any previous sounds, that this Tyrrel was a devilish honest
fellow, and he trusted to be better acquainted with him; while the
crestfallen Squire, privately cursing the stranger by all his gods, had
no mode of silencing his companion but by allowing his loss, and fixing
a day for discussing the bet.</p>

<p>In the public rooms the company examined even microscopically the
response of the stranger to Mr. Winterblossom, straining their ingenuity
to discover, in the most ordinary expressions, a deeper and esoteric
meaning, expressive of something mysterious, and not meant to meet the
eye. Mr. Meiklewham, the writer, dwelt on the word <i>circumstances</i>,
which he read with peculiar emphasis.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, poor lad!&rdquo; he concluded, &ldquo;I doubt he sits cheaper at Meg Dorts's
chimney-corner than he could do with the present company.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Doctor Quackleben, in the manner of a clergyman selecting a word from
his text, as that which is to be particularly insisted upon, repeated in
an under tone, the words, &ldquo;<i>State of health?</i>&mdash;umph&mdash;state of
health?&mdash;Nothing acute&mdash;no one has been sent for&mdash;must be
chronic&mdash;tending to gout, pe<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_75" id="vol_i_Page_75">[Pg&nbsp;75]</a></span>rhaps.&mdash;Or his shyness to society&mdash;light
wild eye&mdash;irregular step&mdash;starting when met suddenly by a stranger, and
turning abruptly and angrily away&mdash;Pray, Mr. Winterblossom, let me have
an order to look over the file of newspapers&mdash;it's very troublesome that
restriction about consulting them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know it is a necessary one, Doctor,&rdquo; said the president; &ldquo;because
so few of the good company read any thing else, that the old newspapers
would have been worn to pieces long since.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, well, let me have the order,&rdquo; said the Doctor; &ldquo;I remember
something of a gentleman run away from his friends&mdash;I must look at the
description.&mdash;I believe I have a strait-jacket somewhere about the
Dispensary.&rdquo;</p>

<p>While this suggestion appalled the male part of the company, who did not
much relish the approaching dinner in company with a gentleman whose
situation seemed so precarious, some of the younger Misses whispered to
each other&mdash;&ldquo;Ah, poor fellow!&mdash;and if it be as the Doctor supposes, my
lady, who knows what the cause of his illness may have been?&mdash;His
<i>spirits</i> he complains of&mdash;ah, poor man!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And thus, by the ingenious commentaries of the company at the Well, on
as plain a note as ever covered the eighth part of a sheet of foolscap,
the writer was deprived of his property, his reason, and his heart, &ldquo;all
or either, or one or other of them,&rdquo; as is briefly and distinctly
expressed in the law phrase.</p>

<p>In short, so much was said <i>pro</i> and <i>con</i>, so many ideas started and
theories maintained, concerning the disposition and character of the
Misanthrope, that<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_76" id="vol_i_Page_76">[Pg&nbsp;76]</a></span>, when the company assembled at the usual time, before
proceeding to dinner, they doubted, as it seemed, whether the expected
addition to their society was to enter the room on his hands or his
feet; and when &ldquo;Mr. Tyrrel&rdquo; was announced by Toby, at the top of his
voice, the gentleman who entered the room had so very little to
distinguish him from others, that there was a momentary disappointment.
The ladies, in particular, began to doubt whether the compound of
talent, misanthropy, madness, and mental sensibility, which they had
pictured to themselves, actually was the same with the genteel, and even
fashionable-looking man whom they saw before them; who, though in a
morning-dress, which the distance of his residence, and the freedom of
the place, made excusable, had, even in the minute points of his
exterior, none of the negligence, or wildness, which might be supposed
to attach to the vestments of a misanthropic recluse, whether sane or
insane. As he paid his compliments round the circle, the scales seemed
to fall from the eyes of those he spoke to; and they saw with surprise,
that the exaggerations had existed entirely in their own preconceptions,
and that whatever the fortunes, or rank in life, of Mr. Tyrrel might be,
his manners, without being showy, were gentlemanlike and pleasing. He
returned his thanks to Mr. Winterblossom in a manner which made that
gentleman recall his best breeding to answer the stranger's address in
kind. He then escaped from the awkwardness of remaining the sole object
of attention, by gliding gradually among the company,&mdash;not like an owl,
which seeks to hide itself in a thicket, or an awkward and retired man,
shrinking from the society into which he is compelled, bu<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_77" id="vol_i_Page_77">[Pg&nbsp;77]</a></span>t with the air
of one who could maintain with ease his part in a higher circle. His
address to Lady Penelope was adapted to the romantic tone of Mr.
Chatterly's epistle, to which it was necessary to allude. He was afraid,
he said, he must complain to Juno of the neglect of Iris, for her
irregularity in delivery of a certain ethereal command, which he had not
dared to answer otherwise than by mute obedience&mdash;unless, indeed, as the
import of the letter seemed to infer, the invitation was designed for
some more gifted individual than he to whom chance had assigned it.</p>

<p>Lady Penelope by her lips, and many of the young ladies with their eyes,
assured him there was no mistake in the matter; that he was really the
gifted person whom the nymphs had summoned to their presence, and that
they were well acquainted with his talents as a poet and a painter.
Tyrrel disclaimed, with earnestness and gravity, the charge of poetry,
and professed, that, far from attempting the art itself, he &ldquo;read with
reluctance all but the productions of the very first-rate poets, and
some of these&mdash;he was almost afraid to say&mdash;he should have liked better
in humble prose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have now only to disown your skill as an artist,&rdquo; said Lady
Penelope, &ldquo;and we must consider Mr. Tyrrel as the falsest and most
deceitful of his sex, who has a mind to deprive us of the opportunity of
benefiting by the productions of his unparalleled endowments. I assure
you I shall put my young friends on their guard. Such dissimulation
cannot be without its object.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I,&rdquo; said Mr. Winterblossom, &ldquo;can produce a piece of real evidence
against the culprit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So saying, he unrolled the sketch which he had filched from T<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_78" id="vol_i_Page_78">[Pg&nbsp;78]</a></span>rotting
Nelly, and which he had pared and pasted, (arts in which he was
eminent,) so as to take out its creases, repair its breaches, and vamp
it as well as my old friend Mrs. Weir could have repaired the damages of
time on a folio Shakspeare.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The vara <i>corpus delicti</i>,&rdquo; said the writer, grinning and rubbing his
hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you are so good as to call such scratches drawings,&rdquo; said Tyrrel, &ldquo;I
must stand so far confessed. I used to do them for my own amusement; but
since my landlady, Mrs. Dods, has of late discovered that I gain my
livelihood by them, why should I disown it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>This avowal, made without the least appearance either of shame or
<i>retenue</i>, seemed to have a striking effect on the whole society. The
president's trembling hand stole the sketch back to the portfolio,
afraid doubtless it might be claimed in form, or else compensation
expected by the artist. Lady Penelope was disconcerted, like an awkward
horse when it changes the leading foot in galloping. She had to recede
from the respectful and easy footing on which he had contrived to place
himself, to one which might express patronage on her own part, and
dependence on Tyrrel's; and this could not be done in a moment.</p>

<p>The Man of Law murmured, &ldquo;Circumstances&mdash;circumstances&mdash;I thought so!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sir Bingo whispered to his friend the Squire, &ldquo;Run out&mdash;blown up&mdash;off
the course&mdash;pity&mdash;d&mdash;&mdash;d pretty fellow he has been!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A raff from the beginning!&rdquo; whispered Mowbray.&mdash;&ldquo;I never thought him
any thing else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'll hold ye a poney of that, my dear, and I'll ask him.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_79" id="vol_i_Page_79">[Pg&nbsp;79]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Done, for a poney, provided you ask him in ten minutes,&rdquo; said the
Squire; &ldquo;but you dare not, Bingie&mdash;he has a d&mdash;&mdash;d cross game look,
with all that civil chaff of his.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Done,&rdquo; said Sir Bingo, but in a less confident tone than before, and
with a determination to proceed with some caution in the matter.&mdash;&ldquo;I
have got a rouleau above, and Winterblossom shall hold stakes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have no rouleau,&rdquo; said the Squire; &ldquo;but I'll fly a cheque on
Meiklewham.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;See it be better than your last,&rdquo; said Sir Bingo, &ldquo;for I won't be
skylarked again. Jack, my boy, you are had.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not till the bet's won; and I shall see yon walking dandy break your
head, Bingie, before that,&rdquo; answered Mowbray. &ldquo;Best speak to the Captain
before hand&mdash;it is a hellish scrape you are running into&mdash;I'll let you
off yet, Bingie, for a guinea forfeit.&mdash;See, I am just going to start
the tattler.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Start, and be d&mdash;&mdash;d!&rdquo; said Sir Bingo. &ldquo;You are gotten, I assure you o'
that, Jack.&rdquo; And with a bow and a shuffle, he went up and introduced
himself to the stranger as Sir Bingo Binks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Had&mdash;honour&mdash;write&mdash;sir,&rdquo; were the only sounds which his throat, or
rather his cravat, seemed to send forth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Confound the booby!&rdquo; thought Mowbray; &ldquo;he will get out of leading
strings, if he goes on at this rate; and doubly confounded be this
cursed tramper, who, the Lord knows why, has come hither from the Lord
knows where, to drive the pigs through my game.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_80" id="vol_i_Page_80">[Pg&nbsp;80]</a></span> meantime, while his friend stood with his stop-watch in his hand,
with a visage lengthened under the influence of these reflections, Sir
Bingo, with an instinctive tact, which self-preservation seemed to
dictate to a brain neither the most delicate nor subtle in the world,
premised his enquiry by some general remark on fishing and field-sports.
With all these, he found Tyrrel more than passably acquainted. Of
fishing and shooting, particularly, he spoke with something like
enthusiasm; so that Sir Bingo began to hold him in considerable respect,
and to assure himself that he could not be, or at least could not
originally have been bred, the itinerant artist which he now gave
himself out&mdash;and this, with the fast lapse of the time, induced him thus
to address Tyrrel.&mdash;&ldquo;I say, Mr. Tyrrel&mdash;why, you have been one of us&mdash;I
say&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you mean a sportsman, Sir Bingo&mdash;I have been, and am a pretty keen
one still,&rdquo; replied Tyrrel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, then, you did not always do them sort of things?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What sort of things do you mean, Sir Bingo?&rdquo; said Tyrrel. &ldquo;I have not
the pleasure of understanding you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, I mean them sketches,&rdquo; said Sir Bingo. &ldquo;I'll give you a handsome
order for them, if you will tell me. I will, on my honour.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does it concern you particularly, Sir Bingo, to know any thing of my
affairs?&rdquo; said Tyrrel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;certainly&mdash;not immediately,&rdquo; answered Sir Bingo, with some
hesitation, for he liked not the dry tone in which Tyrrel's answers were
returned, half so well as a bumper of dry sherry; &ldquo;only I said you were
a d&mdash;&mdash;d gnostic fellow, and I laid a bet you have not been always
professional&mdash;that's all.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_81" id="vol_i_Page_81">[Pg&nbsp;81]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Tyrrel replied, &ldquo;A bet with Mr. Mowbray, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, with Jack,&rdquo; replied the Baronet&mdash;&ldquo;you have hit it&mdash;I hope I have
done him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tyrrel bent his brows, and looked first at Mr. Mowbray, then at the
Baronet, and, after a moment's thought, addressed the latter.&mdash;&ldquo;Sir
Bingo Binks, you are a gentleman of elegant enquiry and acute
judgment.&mdash;You are perfectly right&mdash;I was <i>not</i> bred to the profession
of an artist, nor did I practise it formerly, whatever I may do now; and
so that question is answered.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And Jack is diddled,&rdquo; said the Baronet, smiting his thigh in triumph,
and turning towards the Squire and the stake-holder, with a smile of
exultation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop a single moment, Sir Bingo,&rdquo; said Tyrrel; &ldquo;take one word with you.
I have a great respect for bets,&mdash;it is part of an Englishman's
character to bet on what he thinks fit, and to prosecute his enquiries
over hedge and ditch, as if he were steeple-hunting. But as I have
satisfied you on the subject of two bets, that is sufficient compliance
with the custom of the country; and therefore I request, Sir Bingo, you
will not make me or my affairs the subject of any more wagers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'll be d&mdash;&mdash;d if I do,&rdquo; was the internal resolution of Sir Bingo.
Aloud he muttered some apologies, and w<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_82" id="vol_i_Page_82">[Pg&nbsp;82]</a></span>as heartily glad that the
dinner-bell, sounding at the moment, afforded him an apology for
shuffling off in a different direction.</p>

<i>Table-Talk.</i><br />
</p>


<p>When they were about to leave the room, Lady Penelope assumed Tyrrel's
arm with a sweet smile of condescension, meant to make the honoured
party understand in its full extent the favour conferred. But the
unreasonable artist, far from intimating the least confusion at an
attention so little to be expected, seemed to consider the distinction
as one which was naturally paid to the greatest stranger present; and
when he placed Lady Penelope at the head of the table, by Mr.
Winterblossom the president, and took a chair for himself betwixt her
ladyship and Lady Binks, the provoking wretch appeared no more sensible
of being exalted above his proper rank in society, than if he had been
sitting at the bottom of the table by honest Mrs. Blower from the
Bow-head, who had come to the Well to carry off the dregs of the
<i>Inflienzie</i>, which she scorned to term a surfeit.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_83" id="vol_i_Page_83">[Pg&nbsp;83]</a></span></p>
<p>Now this indifference puzzled Lady Penelope's game extremely, and
irritated her desire to get at the bottom of Tyrrel's mystery, if there
was one, and secure him to her own party. If you were ever at a
watering-place, reader, you know that while the guests do not always pay
the most polite attention to unmarked individuals, the appearance of a
stray lion makes an interest as strong as it is reasonable, and the
Amazonian chiefs of each coterie, like the hunters of Buenos-Ayres,
prepare their <i>lasso</i>, and man&oelig;uvre to the best advantage they can,
each hoping to noose the unsuspicious monster, and lead him captive to
her own menagerie. A few words concerning Lady Penelope Penfeather will
explain why she practised this sport with even more than common zeal.</p>

<p>She was the daughter of an earl, possessed a showy person, and features
which might be called handsome in youth, though now rather too much
<i>prononc&eacute;s</i> to render the term proper. The nose was become sharper; the
cheeks had lost the roundness of youth; and as, during fifteen years
that she had reigned a beauty and a ruling toast, the right man had not
spoken, or, at least, had not spoken at the right time, her ladyship,
now rendered sufficiently independent by the inheritance of an old
relation, spoke in praise of friendship, began to dislike the town in
summer, and to &ldquo;babble of green fields.&rdquo;</p>

<p>About the time Lady Penelope thus changed the tenor of her life, she was
fortunate enough, with Dr. Quackleben's assistance, to find out the
virtues of St Ronan's spring; and having contributed her share to
establish the <i>urbs in rure</i>, which had risen around it, she sat herself
down as leader of the fas<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_84" id="vol_i_Page_84">[Pg&nbsp;84]</a></span>hions in the little province which she had in a
great measure both discovered and colonized. She was, therefore, justly
desirous to compel homage and tribute from all who should approach the
territory.</p>

<p>In other respects, Lady Penelope pretty much resembled the numerous
class she belonged to. She was at bottom a well-principled woman, but
too thoughtless to let her principles control her humour, therefore not
scrupulously nice in her society. She was good-natured, but capricious
and whimsical, and willing enough to be kind or generous, if it neither
thwarted her humour, nor cost her much trouble; would have chaperoned a
young friend any where, and moved the world for subscription tickets;
but never troubled herself how much her giddy charge flirted, or with
whom; so that, with a numerous class of Misses, her ladyship was the
most delightful creature in the world. Then Lady Penelope had lived so
much in society, knew so exactly when to speak, and how to escape from
an embarrassing discussion by professing ignorance, while she looked
intelligence, that she was not generally discovered to be a fool, unless
when she set up for being remarkably clever. This happened more
frequently of late, when, perhaps, as she could not but observe that the
repairs of the toilet became more necessary, she might suppose that new
lights, according to the poet, were streaming on her mind through the
chinks that Time was making. Many of her friends, however, thought that
Lady Penelope would have better consulted her genius by remaining in
mediocrity, as a fashionable and well-bred woman, than by parading her
new-founded pretensions to taste and patronage; but such was not her own
opinion, and doubtless, her ladyship was th<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_85" id="vol_i_Page_85">[Pg&nbsp;85]</a></span>e best judge.</p>

<p>On the other side of Tyrrel sat Lady Binks, lately the beautiful Miss
Bonnyrigg, who, during the last season, had made the company at the Well
alternately admire, smile, and stare, by dancing the highest Highland
fling, riding the wildest pony, laughing the loudest laugh at the
broadest joke, and wearing the briefest petticoat of any nymph of St.
Ronan's. Few knew that this wild, hoydenish, half-mad humour, was only
superinduced over her real character, for the purpose of&mdash;getting well
married. She had fixed her eyes on Sir Bingo, and was aware of his
maxim, that to catch him, &ldquo;a girl must be,&rdquo; in his own phrase, &ldquo;bang up
to every thing;&rdquo; and that he would choose a wife for the neck-or-nothing
qualities which recommend a good hunter. She made out her catch-match,
and she was miserable. Her wild good-humour was entirely an assumed part
of her character, which was passionate, ambitious, and thoughtful.
Delicacy she had none&mdash;she knew Sir Bingo was a brute and a fool, even
while she was hunting him down; but she had so far mistaken her own
feelings, as not to have expected that when she became bone of his bone,
she should feel so much shame and anger when she saw his folly expose
him to be laughed at and plundered, or so disgusted when his brutality
became intimately connected with herself. It is true, he was on the
whole rather an innocent monster; and between bitting and bridling,
coaxing and humouring, might have been made to pad on well enough. But
an unhappy boggling which had taken place previous to the declaration of
their private marriage, had so exasperated her spirits against her
helpmate, that modes of conciliation were the last<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_86" id="vol_i_Page_86">[Pg&nbsp;86]</a></span> she was likely to
adopt. Not only had the assistance of the Scottish Themis, so
propitiously indulgent to the foibles of the fair, been resorted to on
the occasion, but even Mars seemed ready to enter upon the tapis, if
Hymen had not intervened. There was, <i>de par le monde</i>, a certain
brother of the lady&mdash;an officer&mdash;and, as it happened, on leave of
absence,&mdash;who alighted from a hack-chaise at the Fox Hotel, at eleven
o'clock at night, holding in his hand a slip of well-dried oak,
accompanied by another gentleman, who, like himself, wore a military
travelling-cap and a black stock; out of the said chaise, as was
reported by the trusty Toby, was handed a small reise-sac, an Andrew
Ferrara, and a neat mahogany box, eighteen inches long, three deep, and
some six broad. Next morning a solemn <i>palaver</i> (as the natives of
Madagascar call their national convention) was held at an unusual hour,
at which Captain MacTurk and Mr. Mowbray assisted; and the upshot was,
that at breakfast the company were made happy by the information, that
Sir Bingo had been for some weeks the happy bridegroom of their general
favourite; which union, concealed for family reasons, he was now at
liberty to acknowledge, and to fly with the wings of love to bring his
sorrowing turtle from the shades to which she had retired, till the
obstacles to their mutual happiness could be removed. Now, though all
this sounded very smoothly, that gall-less turtle, Lady Binks, could
never think of the tenor of the proceedings without the deepest feelings
of resentment and contempt for the principal actor, Sir Bingo.</p>

<p>Besides all these unpleasant circumstances, Sir Bingo's family had
refused to countenance her wish that he s<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_87" id="vol_i_Page_87">[Pg&nbsp;87]</a></span>hould bring her to his own
seat; and hence a new shock to her pride, and new matter of contempt
against poor Sir Bingo, for being ashamed and afraid to face down the
opposition of his kins-folk, for whose displeasure, though never
attending to any good advice from them, he retained a childish awe.</p>

<p>The manners of the young lady were no less changed than was her temper;
and, from being much too careless and free, were become reserved,
sullen, and haughty. A consciousness that many scrupled to hold
intercourse with her in society, rendered her disagreeably tenacious of
her rank, and jealous of every thing that appeared like neglect. She had
constituted herself mistress of Sir Bingo's purse; and, unrestrained in
the expenses of dress and equipage, chose, contrary to her maiden
practice, to be rather rich and splendid than gay, and to command that
attention by magnificence, which she no longer deigned to solicit by
rendering herself either agreeable or entertaining. One secret source of
her misery was, the necessity of showing deference to Lady Penelope
Penfeather, whose understanding she despised, and whose pretensions to
consequence, to patronage, and to literature, she had acuteness enough
to see through, and to contemn; and this dislike was the more grievous,
that she felt she depended a good deal on Lady Penelope's countenance
for the situation she was able to maintain even among the not very
select society of St. Ronan's Well; and that, neglected by her, she must
have dropped lower in the scale even there. Neither was Lady Penelope's
kindness to Lady Binks extremely cordial. She partook in the ancient and
ordinary dislike of single nymphs of a certain age, to those wh<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_88" id="vol_i_Page_88">[Pg&nbsp;88]</a></span>o made
splendid alliances under their very eye&mdash;and she more than suspected the
secret disaffection of the lady. But the name sounded well; and the
style in which Lady Binks lived was a credit to the place. So they
satisfied their mutual dislike with saying a few sharp things to each
other occasionally, but all under the mask of civility.</p>

<p>Such was Lady Binks; and yet, being such, her dress, and her equipage,
and carriages, were the envy of half the Misses at the Well, who, while
she sat disfiguring with sullenness her very lovely face, (for it was as
beautiful as her shape was exquisite,) only thought she was proud of
having carried her point, and felt herself, with her large fortune and
diamond bandeau, no fit company for the rest of the party. They gave
way, therefore, with meekness to her domineering temper, though it was
not the less tyrannical, that in her maiden state of hoyden-hood, she
had been to some of them an object of slight and of censure; and Lady
Binks had not forgotten the offences offered to Miss Bonnyrigg. But the
fair sisterhood submitted to her retaliations, as lieutenants endure the
bullying of a rude and boisterous captain of the sea, with the secret
determination to pay it home to their underlings, when they shall become
captains themselves.</p>

<p>In this state of importance, yet of penance, Lady Binks occupied her
place at the dinner-table, alternately disconcerted by some stupid
speech of her lord and master, and by some slight sarcasm from Lady
Penelope, to which she longed to reply, but dared not.</p>

<p>She looked from time to time at her neighbour Frank Tyrrel, but without
addressing him, and accepted in silence the usual civilities which he
pr<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_89" id="vol_i_Page_89">[Pg&nbsp;89]</a></span>offered to her. She had remarked keenly his interview with Sir Bingo,
and knowing by experience the manner in which her honoured lord was wont
to retreat from a dispute in which he was unsuccessful, as well as his
genius for getting into such perplexities, she had little doubt that he
had sustained from the stranger some new indignity; whom, therefore, she
regarded with a mixture of feeling, scarce knowing whether to be pleased
with him for having given pain to him whom she hated, or angry with him
for having affronted one in whose degradation her own was necessarily
involved. There might be other thoughts&mdash;on the whole, she regarded him
with much though with mute attention. He paid her but little in return,
being almost entirely occupied in replying to the questions of the
engrossing Lady Penelope Penfeather.</p>

<p>Receiving polite though rather evasive answers to her enquiries
concerning his late avocations, her ladyship could only learn that
Tyrrel had been travelling in several remote parts of Europe, and even
of Asia. Baffled, but not repulsed, the lady continued her courtesy, by
pointing out to him, as a stranger, several individuals of the company
to whom she proposed introducing him, as persons from whose society he
might derive either profit or amusement. In the midst of this sort of
conversation, however, she suddenly stopped short.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you forgive me, Mr. Tyrrel,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;if I say I have been
watching your thoughts for some moments, and that I have detected you?
All the while that I have been talking of these good folks, and that you
have been making such civil replies, that they might be with great
propriety and utility inserted in the &lsquo;Familiar Dialogues, teaching
foreigners how to e<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_90" id="vol_i_Page_90">[Pg&nbsp;90]</a></span>xpress themselves in English upon ordinary
occasions&rsquo;&mdash;your mind has been entirely fixed upon that empty chair,
which hath remained there opposite betwixt our worthy president and Sir
Bingo Binks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I own, madam,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;I was a little surprised at seeing such a
distinguished seat unoccupied, while the table is rather crowded.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, confess more, sir!&mdash;Confess that to a poet a seat unoccupied&mdash;the
chair of Banquo&mdash;has more charms than if it were filled even as an
alderman would fill it.&mdash;What if &lsquo;the Dark Ladye&rsquo;<a name="vol_i_FNanchor_14_14" id="vol_i_FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#vol_i_Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> should glide in
and occupy it?&mdash;would you have courage to stand the vision, Mr.
Tyrrel?&mdash;I assure you the thing is not impossible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>What</i> is not impossible, Lady Penelope?&rdquo; said Tyrrel, somewhat
surprised.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Startled already?&mdash;Nay, then, I despair of your enduring the awful
interview.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What interview? who is expected?&rdquo; said Tyrrel, unable with the utmost
exertion to suppress some signs of curiosity, though he suspected the
whole to be merely some mystification of her ladyship.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How delighted I am,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that I have found out where you are
vulnerable!&mdash;Expected&mdash;did I say expected?&mdash;no, not expected.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&lsquo;She glides, like Night, from land to land,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She hath strange power of speech.&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>&mdash;But come, I have you at my mercy, and I will be generous and
explain.&mdash;We call&mdash;that is, among ourselves, you understand&mdash;Miss Clara
Mowbray, the sister of that gentleman that sits next to Miss Parker, the
Dark Ladye, and that seat is left for her.<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_91" id="vol_i_Page_91">[Pg&nbsp;91]</a></span>&mdash;For she was expected&mdash;no,
not expected&mdash;I forget again!&mdash;but it was thought <i>possible</i> she might
honour us to-day, when our feast was so full and piquant.&mdash;Her brother
is our Lord of the Manor&mdash;and so they pay her that sort of civility to
regard her as a visitor&mdash;and neither Lady Binks nor I think of
objecting&mdash;She is a singular young person, Clara Mowbray&mdash;she amuses me
very much&mdash;I am always rather glad to see her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is not to come hither to-day,&rdquo; said Tyrrel; &ldquo;am I so to understand
your ladyship?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, it is past her time&mdash;even <i>her</i> time,&rdquo; said Lady Penelope&mdash;&ldquo;dinner
was kept back half an hour, and our poor invalids were famishing, as you
may see by the deeds they have done since.&mdash;But Clara is an odd
creature, and if she took it into her head to come hither at this
moment, hither she would come&mdash;she is very whimsical.&mdash;Many people think
her handsome&mdash;but she looks so like something from another world, that
she makes me always think of Mat Lewis's Spectre Lady.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And she repeated with much cadence,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;There is a thing&mdash;there is a thing,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I fain would have from thee;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I fain would have that gay gold ring,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">O warrior, give it me!&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>&ldquo;And then you remember his answer:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&lsquo;This ring Lord Brooke from his daughter took,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And a solemn oath he swore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That that ladye my bride should be<br /></span>
<span class="i2">When this crusade was o'er.&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>You do figures as well as landscapes, I suppose, Mr. Tyrrel?&mdash;You shall
make a sketch for me&mdash;a slight thing&mdash;for sketches, <span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_92" id="vol_i_Page_92">[Pg&nbsp;92]</a></span>I think, show the
freedom of art better than finished pieces&mdash;I dote on the first
coruscations of genius&mdash;flashing like lightning from the cloud!&mdash;You
shall make a sketch for my boudoir&mdash;my dear sulky den at Air Castle, and
Clara Mowbray shall sit for the Ghost Ladye.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That would be but a poor compliment to your ladyship's friend,&rdquo; replied
Tyrrel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Friend? We don't get quite that length, though I like Clara very
well.&mdash;Quite sentimental cast of face&mdash;I think I saw an antique in the
Louvre very like her&mdash;(I was there in 1800)&mdash;quite an antique
countenance&mdash;eyes something hollowed&mdash;care has dug caves for them, but
they are caves of the most beautiful marble, arched with jet&mdash;a straight
nose, and absolutely the Grecian mouth and chin&mdash;a profusion of long
straight black hair, with the whitest skin you ever saw&mdash;as white as the
whitest parchment&mdash;and not a shade of colour in her cheek&mdash;none
whatever&mdash;If she would be naughty, and borrow a prudent touch of
complexion, she might be called beautiful. Even as it is, many think her
so, although surely, Mr. Tyrrel, three colours are necessary to the
female face. However, we used to call her the Melpomene of the Spring
last season, as we called Lady Binks&mdash;who was not then Lady Binks&mdash;our
Euphrosyne&mdash;did we not, my dear?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did we not what, madam?&rdquo; said Lady Binks, in a tone something sharper
than ought to have belonged to so beautiful a countenance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sorry I have started you out of your reverie, my love,&rdquo; answered
Lady Penelope. &ldquo;I was only assuring Mr. Tyrrel that you were once
Euphrosyne, though now so much under the banners of Il Penseroso.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_93" id="vol_i_Page_93">[Pg&nbsp;93]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not know that I have been either one or the other,&rdquo; answered Lady
Binks; &ldquo;one thing I certainly am not&mdash;I am not capable of understanding
your ladyship's wit and learning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor soul,&rdquo; whispered Lady Penelope to Tyrrel; &ldquo;we know what we are, we
know not what we may be.&mdash;And now, Mr. Tyrrel, I have been your sibyl to
guide you through this Elysium of ours, I think, in reward, I deserve a
little confidence in return.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I had any to bestow, which could be in the slightest degree
interesting to your ladyship,&rdquo; answered Tyrrel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! cruel man&mdash;he will not understand me!&rdquo; exclaimed the lady&mdash;&ldquo;In
plain words, then, a peep into your portfolio&mdash;just to see what objects
you have rescued from natural decay, and rendered immortal by the
pencil. You do not know&mdash;indeed, Mr. Tyrrel, you do not know how I dote
upon your &lsquo;serenely silent art,&rsquo; second to poetry alone&mdash;equal&mdash;superior
perhaps&mdash;to music.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I really have little that could possibly be worth the attention of such
a judge as your ladyship,&rdquo; answered Tyrrel; &ldquo;such trifles as your
ladyship has seen, I sometimes leave at the foot of the tree I have been
sketching.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As Orlando left his verses in the Forest of Ardennes?&mdash;Oh, the
thoughtless prodigality!&mdash;Mr. Winterblossom, do you hear this?&mdash;We must
follow Mr. Tyrrel in his walks, and glean what he leaves behind him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her ladyship was here disconcerted by some laughter on Sir Bingo's side
of the table, which she chastised by an angry glance, and then proceeded
emphatically.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_94" id="vol_i_Page_94">[Pg&nbsp;94]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Tyrrel&mdash;this must <i>not</i> be&mdash;this is not the way of the world, my
good sir, to which even genius must stoop its flight. We must consult
the engraver&mdash;though perhaps you etch as well as you draw?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should suppose so,&rdquo; said Mr. Winterblossom, edging in a word with
difficulty, &ldquo;from the freedom of Mr. Tyrrel's touch.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will not deny my having spoiled a little copper now and then,&rdquo; said
Tyrrel, &ldquo;since I am charged with the crime by such good judges; but it
has only been by way of experiment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say no more,&rdquo; said the lady; &ldquo;my darling wish is accomplished!&mdash;We have
long desired to have the remarkable and most romantic spots of our
little Arcadia here&mdash;spots consecrated to friendship, the fine arts, the
loves and the graces, immortalized by the graver's art, faithful to its
charge of fame&mdash;you shall labour on this task, Mr. Tyrrel; we will all
assist with notes and illustrations&mdash;we will all contribute&mdash;only some
of us must be permitted to remain anonymous&mdash;Fairy favours, you know,
Mr. Tyrrel, must be kept secret&mdash;And you shall be allowed the pillage of
the Album&mdash;some sweet things there of Mr. Chatterly's&mdash;and Mr. Edgeit, a
gentleman of your own profession, I am sure will lend his aid&mdash;Dr.
Quackleben will contribute some scientific notices.&mdash;And for
subscription&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Financial&mdash;financial&mdash;your leddyship, I speak to order!&rdquo; said the
writer, interrupting Lady Penelope with a tone of impudent familiarity,
which was meant doubtless for jocular ease.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How am I out of order, Mr. Meiklewham?&rdquo; said her ladyship, drawing
herself up.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_95" id="vol_i_Page_95">[Pg&nbsp;95]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I speak to order!&mdash;No warrants for money can be extracted before
intimation to the Committee of Management.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pray, who mentioned money, Mr. Meiklewham?&rdquo; said her ladyship.&mdash;&ldquo;That
wretched old pettifogger,&rdquo; she added in a whisper to Tyrrel, &ldquo;thinks of
nothing else but the filthy pelf.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye spake of subscription, my leddy, whilk is the same thing as money,
differing only in respect of time&mdash;the subscription being a contract <i>de
futuro</i>, and having a <i>tractus temporis in gremio</i>&mdash;And I have kend mony
honest folks in the company at the Well, complain of the subscriptions
as a great abuse, as obliging them either to look unlike other folk, or
to gie good lawful coin for ballants and picture-books, and things they
caredna a pinch of snuff for.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Several of the company, at the lower end of the table, assented both by
nods and murmurs of approbation; and the orator was about to proceed,
when Tyrrel with difficulty procured a hearing before the debate went
farther, and assured the company that her ladyship's goodness had led
her into an error; that he had no work in hand worthy of their
patronage, and, with the deepest gratitude for Lady Penelope's goodness,
had it not in his power to comply with her request. There was some
tittering at her ladyship's expense, who, as the writer slyly observed,
had been something <i>ultronious</i> in her patronage. Without attempting for
the moment any rally, (as indeed the time which had passed since the
removal of the dinner scar<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_96" id="vol_i_Page_96">[Pg&nbsp;96]</a></span>ce permitted an opportunity,) Lady Penelope
gave the signal for the ladies' retreat, and left the gentlemen to the
circulation of the bottle.</p>

<h3>THE TEA-TABLE.</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</p>


<p>It was common at the Well, for the fair guests occasionally to give tea
to the company,&mdash;such at least as from their rank and leading in the
little society, might be esteemed fit to constitute themselves
patronesses of an evening; and the same lady generally carried the
authority she had acquired into the ball-room, where two fiddles and a
bass, at a guinea a night, with a <i>quantum sufficit</i> of tallow candles,
(against the use of which Lady Penelope often mutinied,) enabled the
company&mdash;to use the appropriate phrase&mdash;&ldquo;to close the evening on the
light fantastic toe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On the present occasion, the lion of the hour, Mr. Francis Tyrrel, had
so little answered the high-wrought expectations of Lady Penelope, that
she rather regretted having ever given herself any trouble about him,
and particularly that of having man&oelig;uvred herself into the patronage
of the tea-table for the evening, to the great expenditure of souchong
and congo. Accordingly, her ladyship had no soo<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_97" id="vol_i_Page_97">[Pg&nbsp;97]</a></span>ner summoned her own
woman, and her <i>fille de chambre</i>, to make tea, with her page, footman,
and postilion, to hand it about, (in which duty they were assisted by
two richly-laced and thickly-powdered footmen of Lady Binks's, whose
liveries put to shame the more modest garb of Lady Penelope's, and even
dimmed the glory of the suppressed coronet upon the buttons,) than she
began to vilipend and depreciate what had been so long the object of her
curiosity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This Mr. Tyrrel,&rdquo; she said, in a tone of authoritative decision, &ldquo;seems
after all a very ordinary sort of person, quite a commonplace man, who,
she dared say, had considered his condition, in going to the old
alehouse, much better than they had done for him, when they asked him to
the Public Rooms. He had known his own place better than they did&mdash;there
was nothing uncommon in his appearance or conversation&mdash;nothing at all
<i>frappant</i>&mdash;she scarce believed he could even draw that sketch. Mr.
Winterblossom, indeed, made a great deal of it; but then all the world
knew that every scrap of engraving or drawing, which Mr. Winterblossom
contrived to make his own, was, the instant it came into his collection,
the finest thing that ever was seen&mdash;that was the way with
collectors&mdash;their geese were all swans.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And your ladyship's swan has proved but a goose, my dearest Lady Pen,&rdquo;
said Lady Binks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>My</i> swan, dearest Lady Binks! I really do not know how I have deserved
the appropriation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do not be angry, my dear Lady Penelope; I only mean, that for a
fortnight and more you have spoke constantly <i>of</i> this Mr. Tyrrel, and
all dinner-time you spoke <i>to</i> him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The fa<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_98" id="vol_i_Page_98">[Pg&nbsp;98]</a></span>ir company began to collect around, at hearing the word <i>dear</i> so
often repeated in the same brief dialogue, which induced them to expect
sport, and, like the vulgar on a similar occasion, to form a ring for
the expected combatants.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He sat betwixt us, Lady Binks,&rdquo; answered Lady Penelope, with dignity.
&ldquo;You had your usual headache, you know, and, for the credit of the
company, I spoke for one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For <i>two</i>, if your ladyship pleases,&rdquo; replied Lady Binks. &ldquo;I mean,&rdquo; she
added, softening the expression, &ldquo;for yourself and me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sorry,&rdquo; said Lady Penelope, &ldquo;I should have spoken for one who can
speak so smartly for herself, as my dear Lady Binks&mdash;I did not, by any
means, desire to engross the conversation&mdash;I repeat it, there is a
mistake about this man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think there is,&rdquo; said Lady Binks, in a tone which implied something
more than mere assent to Lady Penelope's proposition.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I doubt if he is an artist at all,&rdquo; said the Lady Penelope; &ldquo;or if he
is, he must be doing things for some Magazine, or Encyclopedia, or some
such matter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>I</i> doubt, too, if he be a professional artist,&rdquo; said Lady Binks. &ldquo;If
so, he is of the very highest class, for I have seldom seen a
better-bred man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are very well-bred artists,&rdquo; said Lady Penelope. &ldquo;It is the
profession of a gentleman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; answered Lady Binks; &ldquo;but the poorer class have often to
struggle with poverty and dependence. In general society, they are like
commercial people in presence of their customers; and that is a
difficult part to sustain. And so you see them of all sorts&mdash;shy and
reserved, when they are consci<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_99" id="vol_i_Page_99">[Pg&nbsp;99]</a></span>ous of merit&mdash;petulant and whimsical, by
way of showing their independence&mdash;intrusive, in order to appear
easy&mdash;and sometimes obsequious and fawning, when they chance to be of a
mean spirit. But you seldom see them quite at their ease, and therefore
I hold this Mr. Tyrrel to be either an artist of the first class, raised
completely above the necessity and degradation of patronage, or else to
be no professional artist at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lady Penelope looked at Lady Binks with much such a regard as Balaam may
have cast upon his ass, when he discovered the animal's capacity for
holding an argument with him. She muttered to herself&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>&ldquo;Mon ane parle, et m&ecirc;me il parle bien!&rdquo;</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But, declining the altercation which Lady Binks seemed disposed to enter
into, she replied, with good-humour, &ldquo;Well, dearest Rachel, we will not
pull caps about this man&mdash;nay, I think your good opinion of him gives
him new value in my eyes. That is always the way with us, my good
friend! We may confess it, when there are none of these conceited male
wretches among us. We will know what he really is&mdash;he shall not wear
fern-seed, and walk among us invisible thus&mdash;what say you, Maria?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed, I say, dear Lady Penelope,&rdquo; answered Miss Digges, whose ready
chatter we have already introduced to the reader, &ldquo;he is a very handsome
man, though his nose is too big, and his mouth too wide&mdash;but his teeth
are like pearl&mdash;and he has such eyes!&mdash;especially when your ladyship
spoke to him. I don't think you looked at his eyes&mdash;they are quite deep
and dark, and full of glow, like what you read to us in the letter from
that lady, about Robert Burns.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_100" id="vol_i_Page_100">[Pg&nbsp;100]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Upon my word, miss, you come on finely!&rdquo; said Lady Penelope.&mdash;&ldquo;One had
need take care what they read or talk about before you, I see&mdash;Come,
Jones, have mercy upon us&mdash;put an end to that symphony of tinkling cups
and saucers, and let the first act of the tea-table begin, if you
please.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does her leddyship mean the grace?&rdquo; said honest Mrs. Blower, for the
first time admitted into this worshipful society, and busily employed in
arranging an Indian handkerchief, that might have made a mainsail for
one of her husband's smuggling luggers, which she spread carefully on
her knee, to prevent damage to a flowered black silk gown from the
repast of tea and cake, to which she proposed to do due honour&mdash;&ldquo;Does
her leddyship mean the grace? I see the minister is just coming in.&mdash;Her
leddyship waits till ye say a blessing, an ye please, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Winterblossom, who <i>toddled</i> after the chaplain, his toe having
given him an alert hint to quit the dining-table, though he saw every
feature in the poor woman's face swoln with desire to procure
information concerning the ways and customs of the place, passed on the
other side of the way, regardless of her agony of curiosity.</p>

<p>A moment after, she was relieved by the entrance of Dr. Quackleben,
whose maxim being, that one patient was as well worth attention as
another, and who knew by experience, that the <i>honoraria</i> of a godly
wife of the Bow-head were as apt to be forthcoming, (if not more so,) as
my Lady Penelope's, he e'en sat himself quietly down by Mrs. Blower, and
proceeded with the utmost kindness to enquire after<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_101" id="vol_i_Page_101">[Pg&nbsp;101]</a></span> her health, and to
hope she had not forgotten taking a table-spoonful of spirits burnt to a
<i>residuum</i>, in order to qualify the crudities.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed, Doctor,&rdquo; said the honest woman, &ldquo;I loot the brandy burn as lang
as I dought look at the gude creature wasting itsell that gate&mdash;and
then, when I was fain to put it out for very thrift, I did take a
thimbleful of it, (although it is not the thing I am used to, Dr.
Quackleben,) and I winna say but that it did me good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Unquestionably, madam,&rdquo; said the Doctor, &ldquo;I am no friend to the use of
alcohol in general, but there are particular cases&mdash;there are particular
cases, Mrs. Blower&mdash;My venerated instructor, one of the greatest men in
our profession that ever lived, took a wine-glassful of old rum, mixed
with sugar, every day after his dinner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay? dear heart, he would be a comfortable doctor that,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Blower. &ldquo;He wad maybe ken something of my case. Is he leevin' think ye,
sir?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dead for many years, madam,&rdquo; said Dr. Quackleben; &ldquo;and there are but
few of his pupils that can fill his place, I assure ye. If I could be
thought an exception, it is only because I was a favourite. Ah!
blessings on the old red cloak of him!&mdash;It covered more of the healing
science than the gowns of a whole modern university.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is ane, sir,&rdquo; said Mrs. Blower, &ldquo;that has been muckle recommended
about Edinburgh&mdash;Macgregor, I think they ca' him&mdash;folk come far and near
to see him.&rdquo;<a name="vol_i_FNanchor_15_15" id="vol_i_FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#vol_i_Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>&ldquo;I<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_102" id="vol_i_Page_102">[Pg&nbsp;102]</a></span> know whom you mean, ma'am&mdash;a clever man&mdash;no denying it&mdash;a clever
man&mdash;but there are certain cases&mdash;yours, for example&mdash;and I think that
of many that come to drink this water&mdash;which I cannot say I think he
perfectly understands&mdash;hasty&mdash;very hasty and rapid. Now I&mdash;I give the
disease its own way at first&mdash;then watch it, Mrs. Blower&mdash;watch the turn
of the tide.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, troth, that's true,&rdquo; responded the widow; &ldquo;John Blower was aye
watching turn of tide, puir man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then he is a starving doctor, Mrs. Blower&mdash;reduces diseases as soldiers
do towns&mdash;by famine, not considering that the friendly inhabitants
suffer as much as the hostile garrison&mdash;ahem!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here he gave an important and emphatic cough, and then proceeded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am no friend either to excess or to violent stimulus, Mrs.
Blower&mdash;but nature must be supported&mdash;a generous diet&mdash;cordials
judiciously thrown in&mdash;not without the advice of a medical man&mdash;that is
my opinion, Mrs. Blower, to speak as a friend&mdash;others may starve their
patients if they have a mind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It wadna do for me, the starving, Dr. Keekerben,&rdquo; said the alarmed
relict,&mdash;&ldquo;it wadna do for me at a'&mdash;Just a' I can do to wear through the
day with the sma' supports that nature requires&mdash;not a soul to look
after me, Doctor, since John Blower was ta'en awa.&mdash;Thank ye kindly,
sir,&rdquo; (to the servant who handed the tea,)&mdash;&ldquo;thank ye, my bonny man,&rdquo;
(to the page who served the cake)&mdash;&ldquo;Now, dinna ye think, Doctor,&rdquo; (in a
low and confidential voice,) &ldquo;that her leddyship's tea is rather of the
weakliest&mdash;water bewitched, I think&mdash;and Mrs. Jones, as they ca' her,
has cut the seedcake very thin?&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_103" id="vol_i_Page_103">[Pg&nbsp;103]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It is the fashion, Mrs. Blower,&rdquo; answered Dr. Quackleben; &ldquo;and her
ladyship's tea is excellent. But your taste is a little chilled, which
is not uncommon at the first use of the waters, so that you are not
sensible of the flavour&mdash;we must support the system&mdash;reinforce the
digestive powers&mdash;give me leave&mdash;you are a stranger, Mrs. Blower, and we
must take care of you&mdash;I have an elixir which will put that matter to
rights in a moment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So saying, Dr. Quackleben pulled from his pocket a small portable case
of medicines&mdash;&ldquo;Catch me without my tools,&rdquo;&mdash;he said; &ldquo;here I have the
real useful pharmacop&oelig;ia&mdash;the rest is all humbug and hard names&mdash;this
little case, with a fortnight or month, spring and fall, at St. Ronan's
Well, and no one will die till his day come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus boasting, the Doctor drew from his case a large vial or small
flask, full of a high-coloured liquid, of which he mixed three
tea-spoonfuls in Mrs. Blower's cup, who, immediately afterwards, allowed
that the flavour was improved beyond all belief, and that it was &ldquo;vera
comfortable and restorative indeed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will it not do good to my complaints, Doctor?&rdquo; said Mr. Winterblossom,
who had strolled towards them, and held out his cup to the physician.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I by no means recommend it, Mr. Winterblossom,&rdquo; said Dr. Quackleben,
shutting up his case with great coolness; &ldquo;your case is &oelig;dematous,
and you treat it your own way&mdash;you are as good a physician as I am, and
I never interfere with another practitioner's patient.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Doctor,&rdquo; said Winterblos<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_104" id="vol_i_Page_104">[Pg&nbsp;104]</a></span>som, &ldquo;I must wait till Sir Bingo comes
in&mdash;he has a hunting-flask usually about him, which contains as good
medicine as yours to the full.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will wait for Sir Bingo some time,&rdquo; said the Doctor; &ldquo;he is a
gentleman of sedentary habits&mdash;he has ordered another magnum.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir Bingo is an unco name for a man o' quality, dinna ye think sae, Dr.
Cocklehen?&rdquo; said Mrs. Blower. &ldquo;John Blower, when he was a wee bit in the
wind's eye, as he ca'd it, puir fallow&mdash;used to sing a sang about a dog
they ca'd Bingo, that suld hae belanged to a farmer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our Bingo is but a puppy yet, madam&mdash;or if a dog, he is a sad dog,&rdquo;
said Mr. Winterblossom, applauding his own wit, by one of his own
inimitable smiles.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Or a mad dog, rather,&rdquo; said Mr. Chatterly, &ldquo;for he drinks no water;&rdquo;
and he also smiled gracefully at the thoughts of having trumped, as it
were, the president's pun.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Twa pleasant men, Doctor,&rdquo; said the widow, &ldquo;and so is Sir Bungy too,
for that matter; but O! is nae it a pity he should bide sae lang by the
bottle? It was puir John Blower's faut too, that weary tippling; when he
wan to the lee-side of a bowl of punch, there was nae raising him.&mdash;But
they are taking awa the things, and, Doctor, is it not an awfu' thing
that the creature-comforts should hae been used without grace or
thanksgiving?&mdash;that Mr. Chitterling, if he really be a minister, has
muckle to answer for, that he neglects his Master's service.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, madam,&rdquo; said the Doctor, &ldquo;Mr. Chatterly is scarce arrived at the
rank of a minister plenipotentiary.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_105" id="vol_i_Page_105">[Pg&nbsp;105]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;A minister potentiary&mdash;ah, Doctor, I doubt that is some jest of yours,&rdquo;
said the widow; &ldquo;that's sae like puir John Blower. When I wad hae had
him gie up the lovely Peggy, ship and cargo, (the vessel was named after
me, Doctor Kittleben,) to be remembered in the prayers o' the
congregation, he wad say to me, &lsquo;they may pray that stand the risk,
Peggy Bryce, for I've made insurance.&rsquo; He was a merry man, Doctor; but
he had the root of the matter in him, for a' his light way of speaking,
as deep as ony skipper that ever loosed anchor from Leith Roads. I hae
been a forsaken creature since his death&mdash;O the weary days and nights
that I have had!&mdash;and the weight on the spirits&mdash;the spirits,
Doctor!&mdash;though I canna say I hae been easier since I hae been at the
Wall than even now&mdash;if I kend what I was awing ye for elickstir, Doctor,
for it's done me muckle heart's good, forby the opening of my mind to
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fie, fie, ma'am,&rdquo; said the Doctor, as the widow pulled out a seal-skin
pouch, such as sailors carry tobacco in, but apparently well stuffed
with bank-notes,&mdash;&ldquo;Fie, fie, madam&mdash;I am no apothecary&mdash;I have my
diploma from Leyden&mdash;a regular physician, madam,&mdash;the elixir is heartily
at your service; and should you want any advice, no man will be prouder
to assist you than your humble servant.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sure I am muckle obliged to your kindness, Dr. Kickalpin,&rdquo; said
the widow, folding up her pouch; &ldquo;this was puir John Blower's
<i>spleuchan</i>,<a name="vol_i_FNanchor_16_16" id="vol_i_FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#vol_i_Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> as they ca' it&mdash;I e'en wear it for his sake. He was a
kind man, and left me comfortable in warld's gudes; but comforts hae
their cumbers,&mdash;to be a lone woman is a sair weird, Dr. Kittlepin.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_106" id="vol_i_Page_106">[Pg&nbsp;106]</a></span></p>
<p>Dr. Quackleben drew his chair a little nearer that of the widow, and
entered into a closer communication with her, in a tone doubtless of
more delicate consolation than was fit for the ears of the company at
large.</p>

<p>One of the chief delights of a watering-place is, that every one's
affairs seem to be put under the special surveillance of the whole
company, so that, in all probability, the various flirtations,
<i>liaisons</i>, and so forth, which naturally take place in the society, are
not only the subject of amusement to the parties engaged, but also to
the lookers on; that is to say, generally speaking, to the whole
community, of which for the time the said parties are members. Lady
Penelope, the presiding goddess of the region, watchful over all her
circle, was not long of observing that the Doctor seemed to be suddenly
engaged in close communication with the widow, and that he had even
ventured to take hold of her fair plump hand, with a manner which
partook at once of the gallant suitor, and of the medical adviser.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For the love of Heaven,&rdquo; said her ladyship, &ldquo;who can that comely dame
be, on whom our excellent and learned Doctor looks with such uncommon
regard?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fat, fair, and forty,&rdquo; said Mr. Winterblossom; &ldquo;that is all I know of
her&mdash;a mercantile person.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A carrack, Sir President,&rdquo; said the chaplain, &ldquo;richly laden with
colonial produce, by name the Lovely Peggy Bryce&mdash;no master&mdash;the late
John Blower of North Leith having pushed off his boat for the Stygian
Creek, and left the vessel without a hand on board.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_107" id="vol_i_Page_107">[Pg&nbsp;107]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;The Doctor,&rdquo; said Lady Penelope, turning her glass towards them, &ldquo;seems
willing to play the part of pilot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I dare say he will be willing to change her name and register,&rdquo; said
Mr. Chatterly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He can be no less in common requital,&rdquo; said Winterblossom. &ldquo;She has
changed <i>his</i> name six times in the five minutes that I stood within
hearing of them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you think of the matter, my dear Lady Binks?&rdquo; said Lady
Penelope.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Madam?&rdquo; said Lady Binks, starting from a reverie, and answering as one
who either had not heard, or did not understand the question.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mean, what think you of what is going on yonder?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lady Binks turned her glass in the direction of Lady Penelope's glance,
fixed the widow and the Doctor with one bold fashionable stare, and then
dropping her hand slowly, said with indifference, &ldquo;I really see nothing
there worth thinking about.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I dare say it is a fine thing to be married,&rdquo; said Lady Penelope;
&ldquo;one's thoughts, I suppose, are so much engrossed with one's own perfect
happiness, that they have neither time nor inclination to laugh like
other folks. Miss Rachel Bonnyrigg would have laughed till her eyes ran
over, had she seen what Lady Binks cares so little about&mdash;I dare say it
must be an all-sufficient happiness to be married.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He would be a happy man that could convince your ladyship of that in
good earnest,&rdquo; said Mr. Winterblossom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, who knows&mdash;the whim may strike me,&rdquo; replied the lady; &ldquo;but
no&mdash;no&mdash;no;&mdash;and that is three times.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_108" id="vol_i_Page_108">[Pg&nbsp;108]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Say it sixteen times more,&rdquo; said the gallant president, &ldquo;and let
nineteen nay-says be a grant.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I should say a thousand Noes, there exists not the alchymy in living
man that could extract one Yes out of the whole mass,&rdquo; said her
ladyship. &ldquo;Blessed be the memory of Queen Bess!&mdash;She set us all an
example to keep power when we have it&mdash;What noise is that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only the usual after-dinner quarrel,&rdquo; said the divine. &ldquo;I hear the
Captain's voice, else most silent, commanding them to keep peace, in the
devil's name and that of the ladies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Upon my word, dearest Lady Binks, this is too bad of that lord and
master of yours, and of Mowbray, who might have more sense, and of the
rest of that claret-drinking set, to be quarrelling and alarming our
nerves every evening with presenting their pistols perpetually at each
other, like sportsmen confined to the house upon a rainy 12th of August.
I am tired of the Peace-maker&mdash;he but skins the business over in one
case to have it break out elsewhere.&mdash;What think you, love, if we were
to give out in orders, that the next quarrel which may arise, shall be
<i>bona fide</i> fought to an end?&mdash;We will all go out and see it, and wear
the colours on each side; and if there should a funeral come of it, we
will attend it in a body.&mdash;Weeds are so becoming!&mdash;Are they not, my dear
Lady Binks? Look at Widow Blower in her deep black&mdash;don't you envy her,
my love?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lady Binks seemed about to make a sharp and hasty answer, but checked
herself, perhaps under the recollection that she could not prudently
come to an open breach with Lady Penelope.&mdash;At the sa<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_109" id="vol_i_Page_109">[Pg&nbsp;109]</a></span>me moment the door
opened, and a lady dressed in a riding-habit, and wearing a black veil
over her hat, appeared at the entry of the apartment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Angels and ministers of grace!&rdquo; exclaimed Lady Penelope, with her very
best tragic start&mdash;&ldquo;my dearest Clara, why so late? and why thus? Will
you step to my dressing-room&mdash;Jones will get you one of my gowns&mdash;we are
just of a size, you know&mdash;do, pray&mdash;let me be vain of something of my
own for once, by seeing you wear it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was spoken in the tone of the fondest female friendship, and at the
same time the fair hostess bestowed on Miss Mowbray one of those tender
caresses, which ladies&mdash;God bless them!&mdash;sometimes bestow on each other
with unnecessary prodigality, to the great discontent and envy of the
male spectators.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are fluttered, my dearest Clara&mdash;you are feverish&mdash;I am sure you
are,&rdquo; continued the sweetly anxious Lady Penelope; &ldquo;let me persuade you
to lie down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed you are mistaken, Lady Penelope,&rdquo; said Miss Mowbray, who seemed
to receive much as a matter of course her ladyship's profusion of
affectionate politeness:&mdash;&ldquo;I am heated, and my pony trotted hard, that
is the whole mystery.&mdash;Let me have a cup of tea, Mrs. Jones, and the
matter is ended.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fresh tea, Jones, directly,&rdquo; said Lady Penelope, and led her passive
friend to her own corner, as she was pleased to call the recess, in
which she held her little court&mdash;ladies and gentlemen curtsying and
bowing as she passed; to which civilities the new guest made no more
return, than the most ordinary politeness rendered unavoidable.</p>

<p>Lady B<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_110" id="vol_i_Page_110">[Pg&nbsp;110]</a></span>inks did not rise to receive her, but sat upright in her chair,
and bent her head very stiffly; a courtesy which Miss Mowbray returned
in the same stately manner, without farther greeting on either side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, wha can that be, Doctor?&rdquo; said the Widow Blower&mdash;&ldquo;mind ye have
promised to tell me all about the grand folk&mdash;wha can that be that Leddy
Penelope hauds such a racket wi'?&mdash;and what for does she come wi' a
habit and a beaver-hat, when we are a' (a glance at her own gown) in our
silks and satins?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To tell you who she is, my dear Mrs. Blower, is very easy,&rdquo; said the
officious Doctor. &ldquo;She is Miss Clara Mowbray, sister to the Lord of the
Manor&mdash;the gentleman who wears the green coat, with an arrow on the
cape. To tell why she wears that habit, or does any thing else, would be
rather beyond doctor's skill. Truth is, I have always thought she was a
little&mdash;a very little&mdash;touched&mdash;call it nerves&mdash;hypochondria&mdash;or what
you will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lord help us, puir thing!&rdquo; said the compassionate widow.&mdash;&ldquo;And troth it
looks like it. But it's a shame to let her go loose, Doctor&mdash;she might
hurt hersell, or somebody. See, she has ta'en the knife!&mdash;O, it's only
to cut a shave of the diet-loaf. She winna let the powder-monkey of a
boy help her. There's judgment in that though, Doctor, for she can cut
thick or thin as she likes.&mdash;Dear me! she has not taken mair than a
crumb, than ane would pit between the wires of a canary-bird's cage,
after all.&mdash;I wish she would lift up that lang veil, or put off that
riding-skirt, Doctor. She should really be showed the regulations,
Doctor Kickelshin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She care<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_111" id="vol_i_Page_111">[Pg&nbsp;111]</a></span>s about no rules we can make, Mrs. Blower,&rdquo; said the Doctor;
&ldquo;and her brother's will and pleasure, and Lady Penelope's whim of
indulging her, carry her through in every thing. They should take
advice on her case.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, truly, it's time to take advice, when young creatures like her
caper in amang dressed leddies, just as if they were come from
scampering on Leith sands.&mdash;Such a wark as my leddy makes wi' her,
Doctor! Ye would think they were baith fools of a feather.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They might have flown on one wing, for what I know,&rdquo; said Dr.
Quackleben; &ldquo;but there was early and sound advice taken in Lady
Penelope's case. My friend, the late Earl of Featherhead, was a man of
judgment&mdash;did little in his family but by rule of medicine&mdash;so that,
what with the waters, and what with my own care, Lady Penelope is only
freakish&mdash;fanciful&mdash;that's all&mdash;and her quality bears it out&mdash;the
peccant principle might have broken out under other treatment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay&mdash;she has been weel-friended,&rdquo; said the widow; &ldquo;but this bairn
Mowbray, puir thing! how came she to be sae left to hersell?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Her mother was dead&mdash;her father thought of nothing but his sports,&rdquo;
said the Doctor. &ldquo;Her brother was educated in England, and cared for
nobody but himself, if he had been here. What education she got was at
her own hand&mdash;what reading she read was in a library full of old
romances&mdash;what friends or company she had was what chance sent her&mdash;then
no family-physician, not even a good surgeon, within ten miles! And so
you cannot wonder if the poor thing became unsettled.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Puir thing<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_112" id="vol_i_Page_112">[Pg&nbsp;112]</a></span>!&mdash;no doctor!&mdash;nor even a surgeon!&mdash;But, Doctor,&rdquo; said the
widow, &ldquo;maybe the puir thing had the enjoyment of her health, ye ken,
and, then&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! ha, ha!&mdash;why <i>then</i>, madam, she needed a physician far more than if
she had been delicate. A skilful physician, Mrs. Blower, knows how to
bring down that robust health, which is a very alarming state of the
frame when it is considered <i>secundum artem</i>. Most sudden deaths happen
when people are in a robust state of health. Ah! that state of perfect
health is what the doctor dreads most on behalf of his patient.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay, Doctor?&mdash;I am quite sensible, nae doubt,&rdquo; said the widow, &ldquo;of
the great advantage of having a skeelfu' person about ane.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here the Doctor's voice, in his earnestness to convince Mrs. Blower of
the danger of supposing herself capable of living and breathing without
a medical man's permission, sunk into a soft pleading tone, of which our
reporter could not catch the sound. He was, as great orators will
sometimes be, &ldquo;inaudible in the gallery.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Lady Penelope overwhelmed Clara Mowbray with her caresses. In
what degree her ladyship, at her heart, loved this young person, might
be difficult to ascertain,&mdash;probably in the degree in which a child
loves a favourite toy. But Clara was a toy not always to be come by&mdash;as
whimsical in her way as her ladyship in her own, only that poor Clara's
singularities were real, and her ladyship's chiefly affected. Without
adopting the harshness of the Doctor's conclusions concerning the
former, she was certainly unequal in her spirits; and her occasional
fits of levity were chequered by very long intervals of sadness. Her
levity al<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_113" id="vol_i_Page_113">[Pg&nbsp;113]</a></span>so appeared, in the world's eye, greater than it really was;
for she had never been under the restraint of society which was really
good, and entertained an undue contempt for that which she sometimes
mingled with; having unhappily none to teach her the important truth,
that some forms and restraints are to be observed, less in respect to
others than to ourselves. Her dress, her manners, and her ideas, were
therefore very much her own; and though they became her wonderfully,
yet, like Ophelia's garlands, and wild snatches of melody, they were
calculated to excite compassion and melancholy, even while they amused
the observer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And why came you not to dinner?&mdash;We expected you&mdash;your throne was
prepared.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had scarce come to tea,&rdquo; said Miss Mowbray, &ldquo;of my own freewill. But
my brother says your ladyship proposes to come to Shaws-Castle, and he
insisted it was quite right and necessary, to confirm you in so
flattering a purpose, that I should come and say, Pray do, Lady
Penelope; and so now here am I to say, Pray, do come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is an invitation so flattering limited to me alone, my dear
Clara?&mdash;Lady Binks will be jealous.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bring Lady Binks, if she has the condescension to honour us&rdquo;&mdash;[a bow
was very stiffly exchanged between the ladies]&mdash;&ldquo;bring Mr.
Springblossom&mdash;Winterblossom&mdash;and all the lions and lionesses&mdash;we have
room for the whole collection. My brother, I suppose, will bring his own
particular regiment of bears, which, with the usual assortment of
monkeys seen in all caravans, will complete the menagerie. How you are
to be entertained at Shaws-Castle, is, I thank Heaven, not my business,
but John's.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_114" id="vol_i_Page_114">[Pg&nbsp;114]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall want no formal entertainment, my love,&rdquo; said Lady Penelope; &ldquo;a
<i>d&eacute;je&ucirc;ner &agrave; la fourchette</i>&mdash;we know, Clara, you would die of doing the
honours of a formal dinner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a bit; I should live long enough to make my will, and bequeath all
large parties to old Nick, who invented them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Mowbray,&rdquo; said Lady Binks, who had been thwarted by this
free-spoken young lady, both in her former character of a coquette and
romp, and in that of a prude which she at present wore&mdash;&ldquo;Miss Mowbray
declares for</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Champagne and a chicken at last.&rsquo;&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>&ldquo;The chicken without the champagne, if you please,&rdquo; said Miss Mowbray;
&ldquo;I have known ladies pay dear to have champagne on the board.&mdash;By the
by, Lady Penelope, you have not your collection in the same order and
discipline as Pidcock and Polito. There was much growling and snarling
in the lower den when I passed it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was feeding-time, my love,&rdquo; said Lady Penelope; &ldquo;and the lower
animals of every class become pugnacious at that hour&mdash;you see all our
safer and well-conditioned animals are loose, and in good order.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes&mdash;in the keeper's presence, you know&mdash;Well, I must venture to
cross the hall again among all that growling and grumbling&mdash;I would I
had the fairy prince's quarters of mutton to toss among them if they
should break out&mdash;He, I mean, who fetched water from the Fountain of
Lions. However, on second thoughts, I will take the back way, and avoid
them.&mdash;What says honest Bottom?&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_115" id="vol_i_Page_115">[Pg&nbsp;115]</a></span><span class="i0">&lsquo;For if they should as lions come in strife<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into such place, 'twere pity of their life.&rsquo;&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>&ldquo;Shall I go with you, my dear?&rdquo; said Lady Penelope.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;I have too great a soul for that&mdash;I think some of them are lions
only as far as the hide is concerned.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But why would you go so soon, Clara?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because my errand is finished&mdash;have I not invited you and yours? and
would not Lord Chesterfield himself allow I have done the polite thing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you have spoke to none of the company&mdash;how can you be so odd, my
love?&rdquo; said her ladyship.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, I spoke to them all when I spoke to you and Lady Binks&mdash;but I am a
good girl, and will do as I am bid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So saying, she looked round the company, and addressed each of them with
an affectation of interest and politeness, which thinly concealed scorn
and contempt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Winterblossom, I hope the gout is better&mdash;Mr. Robert Rymar&mdash;(I have
escaped calling him Thomas for once)&mdash;I hope the public give
encouragement to the muses&mdash;Mr. Keelavine, I trust your pencil is
busy&mdash;Mr. Chatterly, I have no doubt your flock improves&mdash;Dr.
Quackleben, I am sure your patients recover&mdash;These are all the especials
of the worthy company I know&mdash;for the rest, health to the sick, and
pleasure to the healthy!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are not going in reality, my love?&rdquo; said Lady Penelope; &ldquo;these
hasty rides agitate your nerves&mdash;they do, indeed&mdash;you should be
cautious&mdash;Shall I speak to Quackleben?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To neither Quack nor quackle, on my account, my dear l<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_116" id="vol_i_Page_116">[Pg&nbsp;116]</a></span>ady. It is not as
you would seem to say, by your winking at Lady Binks&mdash;it is not,
indeed&mdash;I shall be no Lady Clementina, to be the wonder and pity of the
spring of St. Ronan's&mdash;No Ophelia neither&mdash;though I will say with her,
Good-night, ladies&mdash;Good night, sweet ladies!&mdash;and now&mdash;not my coach, my
coach&mdash;but my horse, my horse!&rdquo;</p>

<p>So saying, she tripped out of the room by a side passage, leaving the
ladies looking at each other significantly, and shaking their heads with
an expression of much import.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Something has ruffled the poor unhappy girl,&rdquo; said Lady Penelope; &ldquo;I
never saw her so very odd before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Were I to speak my mind,&rdquo; said Lady Binks, &ldquo;I think, as Mrs. Highmore
says in the farce, her madness is but a poor excuse for her
impertinence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh fie! my sweet Lady Binks,&rdquo; said Lady Penelope, &ldquo;spare my poor
favourite! You, surely, of all others, should forgive the excesses of an
amiable eccentricity of temper.&mdash;Forgive me, my love, but I must defend
an absent friend&mdash;My Lady Binks, I am very sure, is too generous and
candid to</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Hate for arts which caused herself to rise.&rsquo;&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>&ldquo;Not being conscious of any high elevation, my lady,&rdquo; answered Lady
Binks, &ldquo;I do not know any arts I have been under the necessity of
practising to attain it. I suppose a Scotch lady of an ancient family
may become the wife of an English baronet, and no very extraordinary
great cause to wonder at it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, surely&mdash;but people in this world will, you know, wonder at
nothing,&rdquo; answered Lady Penelope.</p>

<h3>AFTER DINNER.</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</p>


<p>If the reader has attended much to the manners of the canine race, he
may have remarked the very different manner in which the individuals of
the different sexes carry on their quarrels among each other. The
females are testy, petulant, and very apt to indulge their impatient
dislike of each other's presence, or the spirit of rivalry which it
produces, in a sudden bark and snap, which last is generally made as
much at advantage as possible. But these ebullitions of peevishness lead
to no very serious or prosecuted conflict; the affair begins and ends in
a moment. Not so the ire of the male dogs, which, once produced and
excited by growls of mutual offence and defiance, leads generally to a
fierce and obstinate contest; in which, if the parties be dogs of game,
and well-matched, they grapple, throttle, tear, roll each other in the
kennel, and can only be separated by choking them with their own
collars, till they lose wind and hold at the same time, or by surprising
them out of their wrath by sousing them with cold water.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_119" id="vol_i_Page_119">[Pg&nbsp;119]</a></span></p>
<p>The simile, though a currish one, will hold good in its application to
the human race. While the ladies in the tea-room of the Fox Hotel were
engaged in the light snappish velitation, or skirmish, which we have
described, the gentlemen who remained in the parlour were more than once
like to have quarrelled more seriously.</p>

<p>We have mentioned the weighty reasons which induced Mr. Mowbray to look
upon the stranger whom a general invitation had brought into their
society, with unfavourable prepossessions; and these were far from being
abated by the demeanour of Tyrrel, which, though perfectly well-bred,
indicated a sense of equality, which the young Laird of St. Ronan's
considered as extremely presumptuous.</p>

<p>As for Sir Bingo, he already began to nourish the genuine hatred always
entertained by a mean spirit against an antagonist, before whom it is
conscious of having made a dishonourable retreat. He forgot not the
manner, look, and tone, with which Tyrrel had checked his unauthorized
intrusion; and though he had sunk beneath it at the moment, the
recollection rankled in his heart as an affront to be avenged. As he
drank his wine, courage, the want of which was, in his more sober
moments, a check upon his bad temper, began to inflame his malignity,
and he ventured upon several occasions to show his spleen, by
contradicting Tyrrel more flatly than good manners permitted upon so
short an acquaintance, and without any provocation. Tyrrel saw his ill
humour and despised it, as that of an overgrown schoolboy, whom it was
not worth his while to answer according to his folly.</p>

<p>One of the apparent causes of the Baronet's rude<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_120" id="vol_i_Page_120">[Pg&nbsp;120]</a></span>ness was indeed childish
enough. The company were talking of shooting, the most animating topic
of conversation among Scottish country gentlemen of the younger class,
and Tyrrel had mentioned something of a favourite setter, an uncommonly
handsome dog, from which he had been for some time separated, but which
he expected would rejoin him in the course of next week.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A setter!&rdquo; retorted Sir Bingo, with a sneer; &ldquo;a pointer I suppose you
mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; said Tyrrel; &ldquo;I am perfectly aware of the difference betwixt
a setter and a pointer, and I know the old-fashioned setter is become
unfashionable among modern sportsmen. But I love my dog as a companion,
as well as for his merits in the field; and a setter is more sagacious,
more attached, and fitter for his place on the hearth-rug, than a
pointer&mdash;not,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;from any deficiency of intellects on the
pointer's part, but he is generally so abused while in the management of
brutal breakers and grooms, that he loses all excepting his professional
accomplishments, of finding and standing steady to game.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And who the d&mdash;&mdash;l desires he should have more?&rdquo; said Sir Bingo.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Many people, Sir Bingo,&rdquo; replied Tyrrel, &ldquo;have been of opinion, that
both dogs and men may follow sport indifferently well, though they do
happen, at the same time, to be fit for mixing in friendly intercourse
in society.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is for licking trenchers, and scratching copper, I suppose,&rdquo; said
the Baronet, <i>sotto voce</i>; and added, in a louder and more distinct
tone,&mdash;&ldquo;He never before heard that a setter was fit to follow any man's
heels but a poacher's.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_121" id="vol_i_Page_121">[Pg&nbsp;121]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;You know it now then, Sir Bingo,&rdquo; answered Tyrrel; &ldquo;and I hope you will
not fall into so great a mistake again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Peace-maker here seemed to think his interference necessary, and,
surmounting his tactiturnity, made the following pithy speech:&mdash;&ldquo;By Cot!
and do you see, as you are looking for my opinion, I think there is no
dispute in the matter&mdash;because, by Cot! it occurs to me, d'ye see, that
ye are both right, by Cot! It may do fery well for my excellent friend
Sir Bingo, who hath stables, and kennels, and what not, to maintain the
six filthy prutes that are yelping and yowling all the tay, and all the
neight too, under my window, by Cot!&mdash;And if they are yelping and
yowling there, may I never die but I wish they were yelping and yowling
somewhere else. But then there is many a man who may be as cood a
gentleman at the bottom as my worthy friend Sir Bingo, though it may be
that he is poor; and if he is poor&mdash;and as if it might be my own case,
or that of this honest gentleman, Mr. Tirl&mdash;is that a reason or a law,
that he is not to keep a prute of a tog, to help him to take his sports
and his pleasures? and if he has not a stable or a kennel to put the
crature into, must he not keep it in his pit of ped-room, or upon his
parlour hearth, seeing that Luckie Dods would make the kitchen too hot
for the paist&mdash;and so, if Mr. Tirl finds a setter more fitter for his
purpose than a pointer, by Cot, I know no law against it, else may I
never die the black death.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If this oration appear rather long for the occasion, the reader must
recollect that Captain MacTurk had in all probability the trouble of
translating it from the periphrastic language of Ossian, in which it was
originally conceived in his own mind.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_122" id="vol_i_Page_122">[Pg&nbsp;122]</a></span></p>
<p>The Man of Law replied to the Man of Peace, &ldquo;Ye are mistaken for ance in
your life, Captain, for there is a law against setters; and I will
undertake to prove them to be the &lsquo;lying dogs,&rsquo; which are mentioned in
the auld Scots statute, and which all and sundry are discharged to keep,
under a penalty of&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Here the Captain broke in, with a very solemn mien and dignified
manner&mdash;&ldquo;By Cot! Master Meiklewham, and I shall be asking what you mean
by talking to me of peing mistaken, and apout lying togs, sir&mdash;because I
would have you to know, and to pelieve, and to very well consider, that
I never was mistaken in my life, sir, unless it was when I took you for
a gentleman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No offence, Captain,&rdquo; said Mr. Meiklewham; &ldquo;dinna break the wand of
peace, man, you that should be the first to keep it.&mdash;He is as
cankered,&rdquo; continued the Man of Law, apart to his patron, &ldquo;as an auld
Hieland terrier, that snaps at whatever comes near it&mdash;but I tell you ae
thing, St. Ronan's, and that is on saul and conscience, that I believe
this is the very lad Tirl, that I raised a summons against before the
justices&mdash;him and another hempie&mdash;in your father's time, for shooting on
the Spring-well-head muirs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The devil you did, Mick!&rdquo; replied the Lord of the Manor, also
aside;&mdash;&ldquo;Well, I am obliged to you for giving me some reason for the ill
thoughts I had of him&mdash;I knew he was some trumpery scamp&mdash;I'll blow him,
by&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whisht&mdash;stop&mdash;hush&mdash;haud your tongue, St. Ronan's,&mdash;keep a calm
sough&mdash;ye see, I intended the process, by your worthy father's desire,
before the Quar<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_123" id="vol_i_Page_123">[Pg&nbsp;123]</a></span>ter Sessions&mdash;but I ken na&mdash;The auld sheriff-clerk stood
the lad's friend&mdash;and some of the justices thought it was but a mistake
of the marches, and sae we couldna get a judgment&mdash;and your father was
very ill of the gout, and I was feared to vex him, and so I was fain to
let the process sleep, for fear they had been assoilzied.&mdash;Sae ye had
better gang cautiously to wark, St. Ronan's, for though they were
summoned, they were not convict.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Could you not take up the action again?&rdquo; said Mr. Mowbray.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whew! it's been prescribed sax or seeven year syne. It is a great
shame, St. Ronan's, that the game laws, whilk are the very best
protection that is left to country gentlemen against the encroachment of
their inferiors, rin sae short a course of prescription&mdash;a poacher may
just jink ye back and forward like a flea in a blanket, (wi'
pardon)&mdash;hap ye out of ae county and into anither at their pleasure,
like pyots&mdash;and unless ye get your thum-nail on them in the very nick o'
time, ye may dine on a dish of prescription, and sup upon an
absolvitor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a shame indeed,&rdquo; said Mowbray, turning from his confident and
agent, and addressing himself to the company in general, yet not without
a peculiar look directed to Tyrrel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is a shame, sir?&rdquo; said Tyrrel, conceiving that the observation was
particularly addressed to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That we should have so many poachers upon our muirs, sir,&rdquo; answered St.
Ronan's. &ldquo;I sometimes regret having countenanced the Well here, when I
think how many guns it has brought on my property every season.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_124" id="vol_i_Page_124">[Pg&nbsp;124]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Hout fie! hout awa, St. Ronan's!&rdquo; said his Man of Law; &ldquo;no countenance
the Waal? What would the country-side be without it, I would be glad to
ken? It's the greatest improvement that has been made on this country
since the year forty-five. Na, na, it's no the Waal that's to blame for
the poaching and delinquencies on the game. We maun to the Aultoun for
the howf of that kind of cattle. Our rules at the Waal are clear and
express against trespassers on the game.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can't think,&rdquo; said the Squire, &ldquo;what made my father sell the property
of the old change-house yonder, to the hag that keeps it open out of
spite, I think, and to harbour poachers and vagabonds!&mdash;I cannot
conceive what made him do so foolish a thing!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Probably because your father wanted money, sir,&rdquo; said Tyrrel, dryly;
&ldquo;and my worthy landlady, Mrs. Dods, had got some.&mdash;You know, I presume,
sir, that I lodge there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, sir,&rdquo; replied Mowbray, in a tone betwixt scorn and civility, &ldquo;you
cannot suppose the present company is alluded to; I only presumed to
mention as a fact, that we have been annoyed with unqualified people
shooting on our grounds, without either liberty or license. And I hope
to have her sign taken down for it&mdash;that is all.&mdash;There was the same
plague in my father's days, I think, Mick?&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Mr. Meiklewham, who did not like Tyrrel's looks so well as to induce
him to become approver on the occasion, replied with an inarticulate
grunt, addressed to the company, and a private admonition to his
patron's own ear, &ldquo;to let sleeping dogs lie.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_125" id="vol_i_Page_125">[Pg&nbsp;125]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I can scarce forbear the fellow,&rdquo; said St. Ronan's; &ldquo;and yet I cannot
well tell where my dislike to him lies&mdash;but it would be d&mdash;&mdash;d folly to
turn out with him for nothing; and so, honest Mick, I will be as quiet
as I can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And that you may be so,&rdquo; said Meiklewham, &ldquo;I think you had best take no
more wine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think so too,&rdquo; said the Squire; &ldquo;for each glass I drink in his
company gives me the heartburn&mdash;yet the man is not different from other
raffs either&mdash;but there is a something about him intolerable to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So saying, he pushed back his chair from the table, and&mdash;<i>regis ad
exemplar</i>&mdash;after the pattern of the Laird, all the company arose.</p>

<p>Sir Bingo got up with reluctance, which he testified by two or three
deep growls, as he followed the rest of the company into the outer
apartment, which served as an entrance-hall, and divided the
dining-parlour from the tea-room, as it was called. Here, while the
party were assuming their hats, for the purpose of joining the ladies'
society, (which old-fashioned folk used only to take up for that of
going into the open air,) Tyrrel asked a smart footman, who stood near,
to hand him the hat which lay on the table beyond.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Call your own servant, sir,&rdquo; answered the fellow, with the true
insolence of a pampered menial.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your master,&rdquo; answered Tyrrel, &ldquo;ought to have taught you good manners,
my friend, before bringing you here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir Bingo Binks is my master,&rdquo; said the fellow, in the same insolent
tone as before.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now for it, Bingie,&rdquo; said Mowbray, who was aware that the Baronet's
pot-courage had arrived at fighting pitch.<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_126" id="vol_i_Page_126">[Pg&nbsp;126]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; said Sir Bingo aloud, and more articulately than usual&mdash;&ldquo;The
fellow is my servant&mdash;what has any one to say to it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I at least have my mouth stopped,&rdquo; answered Tyrrel, with perfect
composure. &ldquo;I should have been surprised to have found Sir Bingo's
servant better bred than himself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What d'ye mean by that, sir?&rdquo; said Sir Bingo, coming up in an offensive
attitude, for he was no mean pupil of the Fives-Court&mdash;&ldquo;What d'ye mean
by that? D&mdash;&mdash;n you, sir! I'll serve you out before you can say
dumpling.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I, Sir Bingo, unless you presently lay aside that look and manner,
will knock you down before you can cry help.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The visitor held in his hand a slip of oak, with which he gave a
flourish, that, however slight, intimated some acquaintance with the
noble art of single-stick. From this demonstration Sir Bingo thought it
prudent somewhat to recoil, though backed by a party of friends, who, in
their zeal for his honour, would rather have seen his bones broken in
conflict bold, than his honour injured by a discreditable retreat; and
Tyrrel seemed to have some inclination to indulge them. But, at the very
instant when his hand was raised with a motion of no doubtful import, a
whispering voice, close to his ear, pronounced the emphatic words&mdash;&ldquo;Are
you a man?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Not the thrilling tone with which our inimitable Siddons used to
electrify the scene, when she uttered the same whisper, ever had a more
powerful effect upon an auditor, than had these unexpected sounds on
him, <span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_127" id="vol_i_Page_127">[Pg&nbsp;127]</a></span>to whom they were now addressed. Tyrrel forgot every thing&mdash;his
quarrel&mdash;the circumstances in which he was placed&mdash;the company. The
crowd was to him at once annihilated, and life seemed to have no other
object than to follow the person who had spoken. But suddenly as he
turned, the disappearance of the monitor was at least equally so, for,
amid the group of commonplace countenances by which he was surrounded,
there was none which assorted to the tone and words, which possessed
such a power over him. &ldquo;Make way,&rdquo; he said, to those who surrounded him;
and it was in the tone of one who was prepared, if necessary, to make
way for himself.</p>

<p>Mr. Mowbray of St. Ronan's stepped forward. &ldquo;Come, sir,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;this
will not do&mdash;you have come here, a stranger among us, to assume airs and
dignities, which, by G&mdash;d, would become a duke, or a prince! We must
know who or what you are, before we permit you to carry your high tone
any farther.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This address seemed at once to arrest Tyrrel's anger, and his impatience
to leave the company. He turned to Mowbray, collected his thoughts for
an instant, and then answered him thus:&mdash;&ldquo;Mr. Mowbray, I seek no quarrel
with any one here&mdash;with you, in particular, I am most unwilling to have
any disagreement. I came here by invitation, not certainly expecting
much pleasure, but, at the same time, supposing myself secure from
incivility. In the last point, I find myself mistaken, and therefore
wish the company good-night. I must also make my adieus to the ladies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So saying, he walked several steps, yet, as it seemed, rather
irresolutely, towards the door of the card-room&mdash;an<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_128" id="vol_i_Page_128">[Pg&nbsp;128]</a></span>d then, to the
increased surprise of the company, stopped suddenly, and muttering
something about the &ldquo;unfitness of the time,&rdquo; turned on his heel, and
bowing haughtily, as there was way made for him, walked in the opposite
direction towards the door which led to the outer hall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;D&mdash;&mdash;me, Sir Bingo, will you let him off?&rdquo; said Mowbray, who seemed to
delight in pushing his friend into new scrapes&mdash;&ldquo;To him, man&mdash;to him&mdash;he
shows the white feather.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sir Bingo, thus encouraged, planted himself with a look of defiance
exactly between Tyrrel and the door; upon which the retreating guest,
bestowing on him most emphatically the epithet Fool, seized him by the
collar, and flung him out of his way with some violence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am to be found at the Old Town of St. Ronan's by whomsoever has any
concern with me.&rdquo;&mdash;Without waiting the issue of this aggression farther
than to utter these words, Tyrrel left the hotel. He stopped in the
court-yard, however, with the air of one uncertain whither he intended
to go, and who was desirous to ask some question, which seemed to die
upon his tongue. At length his eye fell upon a groom, who stood not far
from the door of the inn, holding in his hand a handsome pony, with a
side-saddle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whose&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;said Tyrrel&mdash;but the rest of the question he seemed unable to
utter.</p>

<p>The man, however, replied, as if he had heard the whole
interrogation.&mdash;&ldquo;Miss Mowbray's, sir, of St. Ronan's&mdash;she leaves
directly&mdash;and so I am walking the pony&mdash;a clever thing, sir, for a
lady.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She returns to Shaws-Castle by the Buck-stane road?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I su<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_129" id="vol_i_Page_129">[Pg&nbsp;129]</a></span>ppose so, sir,&rdquo; said the groom. &ldquo;It is the nighest, and Miss Clara
cares little for rough roads. Zounds! She can spank it over wet and
dry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tyrrel turned away from the man, and hastily left the hotel&mdash;not,
however, by the road which led to the Aultoun, but by a footpath among
the natural copsewood, which, following the course of the brook,
intersected the usual horse-road to Shaws-Castle, the seat of Mr.
Mowbray, at a romantic spot called the Buck-stane.</p>

<p>In a small peninsula, formed by a winding of the brook, was situated, on
a rising hillock, a large rough-hewn pillar of stone, said by tradition
to commemorate the fall of a stag of unusual speed, size, and strength,
whose flight, after having lasted through a whole summer's day, had
there terminated in death, to the honour and glory of some ancient baron
of St. Ronan's, and of his stanch hounds. During the periodical cuttings
of the copse, which the necessities of the family of St. Ronan's brought
round more frequently than Ponty would have recommended, some oaks had
been spared in the neighbourhood of this massive obelisk, old enough
perhaps to have heard the whoop and halloo which followed the fall of
the stag, and to have witnessed the raising of the rude monument by
which that great event was commemorated. These trees, with their broad
spreading boughs, made a twilight even of noon-day; and, now that the
sun was approaching its setting point, their shade already anticipated
night. This was especially the case where three or four of them
stretched their arms over a deep gully, through which winded the
horse-path to Shaws-Castle, at a point about a pistol-shot distant from
the Buck-stane. As the principal acce<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_130" id="vol_i_Page_130">[Pg&nbsp;130]</a></span>ss to Mr. Mowbray's mansion was by
a carriage-way, which passed in a different direction, the present path
was left almost in a state of nature, full of large stones, and broken
by gullies, delightful, from the varied character of its banks, to the
picturesque traveller, and most inconvenient, nay dangerous, to him who
had a stumbling horse.</p>

<p>The footpath to the Buck-stane, which here joined the bridle-road, had
been constructed, at the expense of a subscription, under the direction
of Mr. Winterblossom, who had taste enough to see the beauties of this
secluded spot, which was exactly such as in earlier times might have
harboured the ambush of some marauding chief. This recollection had not
escaped Tyrrel, to whom the whole scenery was familiar, who now hastened
to the spot, as one which peculiarly suited his present purpose. He sat
down by one of the larger projecting trees, and, screened by its
enormous branches from observation, was enabled to watch the road from
the Hotel for a great part of its extent, while he was himself invisible
to any who might travel upon it.</p>

<p>Meanwhile his sudden departure excited a considerable sensation among
the party whom he had just left, and who were induced to form
conclusions not very favourable to his character. Sir Bingo, in
particular, blustered loudly and more loudly, in proportion to the
increasing distance betwixt himself and his antagonist, declaring his
resolution to be revenged on the scoundrel for his insolence&mdash;to drive
him from the neighbourhood&mdash;and I know not what other menaces of
formidable import. The devil, in the old stories of <i>di&agrave;blerie</i>, was
always sure to start up at the elbow of any one who nursed diabolical
purposes, and only wanted a little backing<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_131" id="vol_i_Page_131">[Pg&nbsp;131]</a></span> from the foul fiend to carry
his imaginations into action. The noble Captain MacTurk had so far this
property of his infernal majesty, that the least hint of an approaching
quarrel drew him always to the vicinity of the party concerned. He was
now at Sir Bingo's side, and was taking his own view of the matter, in
his character of peace-maker.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By Cot! and it's very exceedingly true, my goot friend, Sir Binco&mdash;and
as you say, it concerns your honour, and the honour of the place, and
credit and character of the whole company, by Cot! that this matter be
properly looked after; for, as I think, he laid hands on your body, my
excellent goot friend.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hands, Captain MacTurk!&rdquo; exclaimed Sir Bingo, in some confusion; &ldquo;no,
blast him&mdash;not so bad as that neither&mdash;if he had, I should have handed
<i>him</i> over the window&mdash;but, by &mdash;&mdash;, the fellow had the impudence to
offer to collar me&mdash;I had just stepped back to square at him, when,
curse me, the blackguard ran away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Right, vara right, Sir Bingo,&rdquo; said the Man of Law, &ldquo;a vara perfect
blackguard, a poaching sorning sort of fallow, that I will have scoured
out of the country before he be three days aulder. Fash you your beard
nae farther about the matter, Sir Bingo.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By Cot! but I can tell you, Mr. Meiklewham,&rdquo; said the Man of Peace,
with great solemnity of visage, &ldquo;that you are scalding your lips in
other folk's kale, and that it is necessary for the credit, and honour,
and respect of this company, at the Well of St. Ronan's, that Sir Bingo
goes by more competent advice than yours upon the pres<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_132" id="vol_i_Page_132">[Pg&nbsp;132]</a></span>ent occasion, Mr.
Meiklewham; for though your counsel may do very well in a small debt
court, here, you see, Mr. Meiklewham, is a question of honour, which is
not a thing in your line, as I take it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, before George! it is not,&rdquo; answered Meiklewham; &ldquo;e'en take it all
to yoursell, Captain, and meikle ye are likely to make on't.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said the Captain, &ldquo;Sir Binco, I will beg the favour of your
company to the smoking room, where we may have a cigar and a glass of
gin-twist; and we will consider how the honour of the company must be
supported and upholden upon the present conjuncture.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Baronet complied with this invitation, as much, perhaps, in
consequence of the medium through which the Captain intended to convey
his warlike counsels, as for the pleasure with which he anticipated the
result of these counsels themselves. He followed the military step of
his leader, whose stride was more stiff, and his form more
perpendicular, when exalted by the consciousness of an approaching
quarrel, to the smoking-room, where, sighing as he lighted his cigar,
Sir Bingo prepared to listen to the words of wisdom and valour, as they
should flow in mingled stream from the lips of Captain MacTurk.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the rest of the company joined the ladies. &ldquo;Here has been
Clara,&rdquo; said Lady Penelope to Mr. Mowbray; &ldquo;here has been Miss Mowbray
among us, like the ray of a sun which does but dazzle and die.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, poor Clara,&rdquo; said Mowbray; &ldquo;I thought I saw her thread her way
through the crowd a little while since, but I was not sure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Lady Penelope, &ldquo;she h<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_133" id="vol_i_Page_133">[Pg&nbsp;133]</a></span>as asked us all up to Shaws-Castle on
Thursday, to a <i>d&eacute;je&ucirc;ner &agrave; la fourchette</i>&mdash;I trust you confirm your
sister's invitation, Mr. Mowbray?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly, Lady Penelope,&rdquo; replied Mowbray; &ldquo;and I am truly glad Clara
has had the grace to think of it&mdash;How we shall acquit ourselves is a
different question, for neither she nor I are much accustomed to play
host or hostess.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! it will be delightful, I am sure,&rdquo; said Lady Penelope; &ldquo;Clara has a
grace in every thing she does; and you, Mr. Mowbray, can be a perfectly
well-bred gentleman&mdash;when you please.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That qualification is severe&mdash;Well&mdash;good manners be my speed&mdash;I will
certainly please to do my best, when I see your ladyship at
Shaws-Castle, which has received no company this many a day.&mdash;Clara and
I have lived a wild life of it, each in their own way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed, Mr. Mowbray,&rdquo; said Lady Binks, &ldquo;if I might presume to speak&mdash;I
think you do suffer your sister to ride about a little too much without
an attendant. I know Miss Mowbray rides as woman never rode before, but
still an accident may happen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;An accident?&rdquo; replied Mowbray&mdash;&ldquo;Ah, Lady Binks! accidents happen as
frequently when ladies <i>have</i> attendants as when they are without them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lady Binks, who, in her maiden state, had cantered a good deal about
these woods under Sir Bingo's escort, coloured, looked spiteful, and was
silent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; said John Mowbray, more lightly, &ldquo;where is the risk, after
all? There are no wolves in our woods to eat up our pretty Red-Riding
Hoods; and no lions either&mdash;except those of Lady Penelope's train.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who draw the car of Cybele,&rdquo; said Mr. Chatt<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_134" id="vol_i_Page_134">[Pg&nbsp;134]</a></span>erly.</p>

<p>Lady Penelope luckily did not understand the allusion, which was indeed
better intended than imagined.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Apropos!&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;what have you done with the great lion of the day?
I see Mr. Tyrrel nowhere&mdash;Is he finishing an additional bottle with Sir
Bingo?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Tyrrel, madam,&rdquo; said Mowbray, &ldquo;has acted successively the lion
rampant, and the lion passant: he has been quarrelsome, and he has run
away&mdash;fled from the ire of your doughty knight, Lady Binks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sure I hope not,&rdquo; said Lady Binks; &ldquo;my Chevalier's unsuccessful
campaigns have been unable to overcome his taste for quarrels&mdash;a victory
would make a fighting-man of him for life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That inconvenience might bring its own consolations,&rdquo; said
Winterblossom, apart to Mowbray; &ldquo;quarrellers do not usually live long.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; replied Mowbray, &ldquo;the lady's despair, which broke out just
now, even in her own despite, is quite natural&mdash;absolutely legitimate.
Sir Bingo will give her no chance that way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mowbray then made his bow to Lady Penelope, and in answer to her request
that he would join the ball or the card-table, observed, that he had no
time to lose; that the heads of the old domestics at Shaws-Castle would
be by this time absolutely turned, by the apprehensions of what Thursday
was to bring forth; and that as Clara would certainly give no directions
for the proper arrangements, it was necessary that he should take that
trouble himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you r<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_135" id="vol_i_Page_135">[Pg&nbsp;135]</a></span>ide smartly,&rdquo; said Lady Penelope, &ldquo;you may save even a
temporary alarm, by overtaking Clara, dear creature, ere she gets
home&mdash;She sometimes suffers her pony to go at will along the lane, as
slow as Betty Foy's.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, but then,&rdquo; said little Miss Digges, &ldquo;Miss Mowbray sometimes gallops
as if the lark was a snail to her pony&mdash;and it quite frights one to see
her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Doctor touched Mrs. Blower, who had approached so as to be on the
verge of the genteel circle, though she did not venture within it&mdash;they
exchanged sagacious looks, and a most pitiful shake of the head.
Mowbray's eye happened at that moment to glance on them; and doubtless,
notwithstanding their hasting to compose their countenances to a
different expression, he comprehended what was passing through their
minds;&mdash;and perhaps it awoke a corresponding note in his own. He took
his hat, and with a cast of thought upon his countenance which it seldom
wore, left the apartment. A moment afterwards his horse's feet were
heard spurning the pavement, as he started off at a sharp pace.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is something singular about these Mowbrays to-night,&rdquo; said Lady
Penelope.&mdash;&ldquo;Clara, poor dear angel, is always particular; but I should
have thought Mowbray had too much worldly wisdom to be fanciful.&mdash;What
are you consulting your <i>souvenir</i> for with such attention, my dear Lady
Binks?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only for the age of the moon,&rdquo; said her ladyship, putting the little
tortoise-shell-bound calendar into her reticule; and having done so, she
proceeded to a<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_136" id="vol_i_Page_136">[Pg&nbsp;136]</a></span>ssist Lady Penelope in the arrangements for the evening.</p>

<h3>THE MEETING.</h3>

<i>Anonymous.</i><br />
</p>


<p>Behind one of the old oaks which we have described in the preceding
chapter, shrouding himself from observation like a hunter watching for
his game, or an Indian for his enemy, but with different, very different
purpose, Tyrrel lay on his breast near the Buck-stane, his eye on the
horse-road which winded down the valley, and his ear alertly awake to
every sound which mingled with the passing breeze, or with the ripple of
the brook.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To have met her in yonder congregated assembly of brutes and
fools&rdquo;&mdash;such was a part of his internal reflections,&mdash;&ldquo;had been little
less than an act of madness&mdash;madness almost equal in its degree to that
cowardice which has hitherto prevented my approaching her, when our
eventful meeting might have taken place unobserved.&mdash;But now&mdash;now&mdash;my
resolution is as fixed as the place is itself favourable. I will not
wait till some chance again shall throw us together, with an hundred
malignant eyes to watch, and wonder, and stare, and try in vain to<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_137" id="vol_i_Page_137">[Pg&nbsp;137]</a></span>
account for the expression of feelings which I might find it impossible
to suppress.&mdash;Hark&mdash;hark!&mdash;I hear the tread of a horse&mdash;No&mdash;it was the
changeful sound of the water rushing over the pebbles. Surely she cannot
have taken the other road to Shaws-Castle!&mdash;No&mdash;the sounds become
distinct&mdash;her figure is visible on the path, coming swiftly
forward.&mdash;Have I the courage to show myself?&mdash;I have&mdash;the hour is come,
and what must be shall be.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 415px;">
<img src="images/illus-1.137.jpg" width="415" height="600" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>Yet this resolution was scarcely formed ere it began to fluctuate, when
he reflected upon the fittest manner of carrying it into execution. To
show himself at a distance, might give the lady an opportunity of
turning back and avoiding the interview which he had determined upon&mdash;to
hide himself till the moment when her horse, in rapid motion, should
pass his lurking-place, might be attended with danger to the rider&mdash;and
while he hesitated which course to pursue, there was some chance of his
missing the opportunity of presenting himself to Miss Mowbray at all. He
was himself sensible of this, formed a hasty and desperate resolution
not to suffer the present moment to escape, and, just as the ascent
induced the pony to slacken its pace, Tyrrel stood in the middle of the
defile, about six yards distant from the young lady.</p>

<p>She pulled up the reins, and stopped as if arrested by a
thunderbolt.&mdash;&ldquo;Clara!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Tyrrel!&rdquo; These were the only words which were
exchanged between them, until Tyrrel, moving his feet as slowly as if
they had been of lead, began gradually to diminish the distance which
lay betwixt them. It was then that, observing his closer approach, Miss
Mowbray called out with<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_138" id="vol_i_Page_138">[Pg&nbsp;138]</a></span> great eagerness,&mdash;&ldquo;No nearer&mdash;no nearer!&mdash;So
long have I endured your presence, but if you approach me more closely,
I shall be mad indeed!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you fear?&rdquo; said Tyrrel, in a hollow voice&mdash;&ldquo;What can you fear?&rdquo;
and he continued to draw nearer, until they were within a pace of each
other.</p>

<p>Clara, meanwhile, dropping her bridle, clasped her hands together, and
held them up towards Heaven, muttering, in a voice scarcely audible,
&ldquo;Great God!&mdash;If this apparition be formed by my heated fancy, let it
pass away; if it be real, enable me to bear its presence!&mdash;Tell me, I
conjure you, are you Francis Tyrrel in blood and body, or is this but
one of those wandering visions, that have crossed my path and glared on
me, but without daring to abide my steadfast glance?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am Francis Tyrrel,&rdquo; answered he, &ldquo;in blood and body, as much as she
to whom I speak is Clara Mowbray.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then God have mercy on us both!&rdquo; said Clara, in a tone of deep feeling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Amen!&rdquo; said Tyrrel.&mdash;&ldquo;But what avails this excess of agitation?&mdash;You
saw me but now, Miss Mowbray&mdash;Your voice still rings in my ears&mdash;You saw
me but now&mdash;you spoke to me&mdash;and that when I was among strangers&mdash;Why
not preserve your composure, when we are where no human eye can see&mdash;no
human ear can hear?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it so?&rdquo; said Clara; &ldquo;and was it indeed yourself whom I saw even
now?&mdash;I thought so, and something I said at the time&mdash;but my brain has
been but ill settled since we last met&mdash;But I am well now&mdash;quite well&mdash;I
have invited all the people yonder to come to Shaws-Castle&mdash;my brother
desired m<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_139" id="vol_i_Page_139">[Pg&nbsp;139]</a></span>e to do it&mdash;I hope I shall have the pleasure of seeing Mr.
Tyrrel there&mdash;though I think there is some old grudge between my brother
and you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alas! Clara, you mistake. Your brother I have scarcely seen,&rdquo; replied
Tyrrel, much distressed, and apparently uncertain in what tone to
address her, which might soothe, and not irritate her mental malady, of
which he could now entertain no doubt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;True&mdash;true,&rdquo; she said, after a moment's reflection, &ldquo;my brother was
then at college. It was my father, my poor father, whom you had some
quarrel with.&mdash;But you will come to Shaws-Castle on Thursday, at two
o'clock?&mdash;John will be glad to see you&mdash;he can be kind when he
pleases&mdash;and then we will talk of old times&mdash;I must get on, to have
things ready&mdash;Good evening.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She would have passed him, but he took gently hold of the rein of her
bridle.&mdash;&ldquo;I will walk with you, Clara,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;the road is rough and
dangerous&mdash;you ought not to ride fast.&mdash;I will walk along with you, and
we will talk of former times now, more conveniently than in company.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;True&mdash;true&mdash;very true, Mr. Tyrrel&mdash;it shall be as you say. My brother
obliges me sometimes to go into company at that hateful place down
yonder; and I do so because he likes it, and because the folks let me
have my own way, and come and go as I list. Do you know, Tyrrel, that
very often when I am there, and John has his eye on me, I can carry it
on as gaily as if you and I had never met?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would to God we never had,&rdquo; said Tyrrel, in a trembling voice, &ldquo;since
this is to be the end of all!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And wherefore should not sorrow be the end of sin and of folly? And
when did happiness come of<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_140" id="vol_i_Page_140">[Pg&nbsp;140]</a></span> disobedience?&mdash;And when did sound sleep visit
a bloody pillow? That is what I say to myself, Tyrrel, and that is what
you must learn to say too, and then you will bear your burden as
cheerfully as I endure mine. If we have no more than our deserts, why
should we complain?&mdash;You are shedding tears, I think&mdash;Is not that
childish?&mdash;They say it is a relief&mdash;if so, weep on, and I will look
another way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tyrrel walked on by the pony's side, in vain endeavouring to compose
himself so as to reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor Tyrrel,&rdquo; said Clara, after she had remained silent for some
time&mdash;&ldquo;Poor Frank Tyrrel!&mdash;Perhaps you will say in your turn, Poor
Clara&mdash;but I am not so poor in spirit as you&mdash;the blast may bend, but it
shall never break me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was another long pause; for Tyrrel was unable to determine with
himself in what strain he could address the unfortunate young lady,
without awakening recollections equally painful to her feelings, and
dangerous, when her precarious state of health was considered. At length
she herself proceeded:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What needs all this, Tyrrel?&mdash;and indeed, why came you here?&mdash;Why did I
find you but now brawling and quarrelling among the loudest of the
brawlers and quarrellers of yonder idle and dissipated debauchees?&mdash;You
were used to have more temper&mdash;more sense. Another person&mdash;ay, another
that you and I once knew&mdash;he might have committed such a folly, and he
would have acted perhaps in character.&mdash;But you, who pretend to
wisdom&mdash;for shame, for shame!&mdash;And indeed, when we talk of that, what
wisdom was there in coming hither at<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_141" id="vol_i_Page_141">[Pg&nbsp;141]</a></span> all?&mdash;or what good purpose can your
remaining here serve?&mdash;Surely you need not come, either to renew your
own unhappiness or to augment mine?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To augment yours&mdash;God forbid!&rdquo; answered Tyrrel. &ldquo;No&mdash;I came hither only
because, after so many years of wandering, I longed to revisit the spot
where all my hopes lay buried.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay&mdash;buried is the word,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;crushed down and buried when
they budded fairest. I often think of it, Tyrrel; and there are times
when, Heaven help me! I can think of little else.&mdash;Look at me&mdash;you
remember what I was&mdash;see what grief and solitude have made me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She flung back the veil which surrounded her riding-hat, and which had
hitherto hid her face. It was the same countenance which he had formerly
known in all the bloom of early beauty; but though the beauty remained,
the bloom was fled for ever. Not the agitation of exercise&mdash;not that
which arose from the pain and confusion of this unexpected interview,
had called to poor Clara's cheek even the momentary semblance of colour.
Her complexion was marble-white, like that of the finest piece of
statuary.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it possible?&rdquo; said Tyrrel; &ldquo;can grief have made such ravages?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Grief,&rdquo; replied Clara, &ldquo;is the sickness of the mind, and its sister is
the sickness of the body&mdash;they are twin-sisters, Tyrrel, and are seldom
long separate. Sometimes the body's disease comes first, and dims our
eyes and palsies our hands, before the fire of our mind and of our
intellect is quenched. But mark me&mdash;soon after comes her cruel sister
with her urn, and sprinkles cold dew on our hopes and on our loves, our
memory, our recollections, and our feelings, and shows us that they
cannot survive the decay of our bodily pow<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_142" id="vol_i_Page_142">[Pg&nbsp;142]</a></span>ers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; said Tyrrel, &ldquo;is it come to this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To this,&rdquo; she replied, speaking from the rapid and irregular train of
her own ideas, rather than comprehending the purport of his sorrowful
exclamation,&mdash;&ldquo;to this it must ever come, while immortal souls are
wedded to the perishable substance of which our bodies are composed.
There is another state, Tyrrel, in which it will be otherwise&mdash;God grant
our time of enjoying it were come!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She fell into a melancholy pause, which Tyrrel was afraid to disturb.
The quickness with which she spoke, marked but too plainly the irregular
succession of thought, and he was obliged to restrain the agony of his
own feelings, rendered more acute by a thousand painful recollections,
lest, by giving way to his expressions of grief, he should throw her
into a still more disturbed state of mind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did not think,&rdquo; she proceeded, &ldquo;that after so horrible a separation,
and so many years, I could have met you thus calmly and reasonably. But
although what we were formerly to each other can never be forgotten, it
is now all over, and we are only friends&mdash;Is it not so?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tyrrel was unable to reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I must not remain here,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;till the evening grows darker
on me.&mdash;We shall meet again, Tyrrel&mdash;meet as friends&mdash;nothing more&mdash;You
will come up to Shaws-Castle and see me?&mdash;no need of secrecy now&mdash;my
poor father is in his grave, and his prejudices sleep with him&mdash;my
brother John is kind, though he is stern and severe sometimes&mdash;Indeed,
Tyrrel, I believe he loves me, though he has taught me to tremble at his
frown w<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_143" id="vol_i_Page_143">[Pg&nbsp;143]</a></span>hen I am in spirits, and talk too much&mdash;But he loves me, at least
I think so, for I am sure I love him; and I try to go down amongst them
yonder, and to endure their folly, and, all things considered, I do
carry on the farce of life wonderfully well&mdash;We are but actors, you
know, and the world but a stage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And ours has been a sad and tragic scene,&rdquo; said Tyrrel, in the
bitterness of his heart, unable any longer to refrain from speech.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It has indeed&mdash;but, Tyrrel, when was it otherwise with engagements
formed in youth and in folly? You and I would, you know, become men and
women, while we were yet scarcely more than children&mdash;We have run, while
yet in our nonage, through the passions and adventures of youth, and
therefore we are now old before our day, and the winter of our life has
come on ere its summer was well begun.&mdash;O Tyrrel! often and often have I
thought of this!&mdash;Thought of it often? Alas, when will the time come
that I shall be able to think of any thing else!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The poor young woman sobbed bitterly, and her tears began to flow with a
freedom which they had not probably enjoyed for a length of time. Tyrrel
walked on by the side of her horse, which now prosecuted its road
homewards, unable to devise a proper mode of addressing the unfortunate
young lady, and fearing alike to awaken her passions and his own.
Whatever he might have proposed to say, was disconcerted by the plain
indications that her mind was clouded, more or less slightly, with a
shade of insanity, which deranged, though it had not destroyed, her
powers of judgment.</p>

<p>At length he asked her, with as much calmness as he <span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_144" id="vol_i_Page_144">[Pg&nbsp;144]</a></span>could assume&mdash;if she
was contented&mdash;if aught could be done to render her situation more
easy&mdash;if there was aught of which she could complain which he might be
able to remedy? She answered gently, that she was calm and resigned,
when her brother would permit her to stay at home; but that when she was
brought into society, she experienced such a change as that which the
water of the brook that slumbers in a crystalline pool of the rock may
be supposed to feel, when, gliding from its quiet bed, it becomes
involved in the hurry of the cataract.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But my brother Mowbray,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;thinks he is right,&mdash;and perhaps he
is so. There are things on which we may ponder too long;&mdash;and were he
mistaken, why should I not constrain myself in order to please
him&mdash;there are so few left to whom I can now give either pleasure or
pain?&mdash;I am a gay girl, too, in conversation, Tyrrel&mdash;still as gay for a
moment, as when you used to chide me for my folly. So, now I have told
you all,&mdash;I have one question to ask on my part&mdash;one question&mdash;if I had
but breath to ask it&mdash;Is <i>he</i> still alive?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He lives,&rdquo; answered Tyrrel, but in a tone so low, that nought but the
eager attention which Miss Mowbray paid could possibly have caught such
feeble sounds.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lives!&rdquo; she exclaimed,&mdash;&ldquo;lives!&mdash;he lives, and the blood on your hand
is not then indelibly imprinted&mdash;O Tyrrel, did you but know the joy
which this assurance gives to me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Joy!&rdquo; replied Tyrrel&mdash;&ldquo;joy, that the wretch lives who has poisoned our
happiness for ever?&mdash;lives, perhaps, to claim you for his own?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never, never shall he&mdash;dare he do so,&rdquo; replied Clara, wildly, &ldquo;while
water can drown, while cords can strangle, steel pierce&mdash;while there is
a precipice on the hill, a pool in the river<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_145" id="vol_i_Page_145">[Pg&nbsp;145]</a></span>&mdash;never&mdash;never!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be not thus agitated, my dearest Clara,&rdquo; said Tyrrel; &ldquo;I spoke I know
not what&mdash;he lives indeed&mdash;but far distant, and, I trust, never again to
revisit Scotland.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He would have said more, but that, agitated with fear or passion, she
struck her horse impatiently with her riding-whip. The spirited animal,
thus stimulated and at the same time restrained, became intractable, and
reared so much, that Tyrrel, fearful of the consequences, and trusting
to Clara's skill as a horsewoman, thought he best consulted her safety
in letting go the rein. The animal instantly sprung forward on the
broken and hilly path at a very rapid pace, and was soon lost to
Tyrrel's anxious eyes.</p>

<p>As he stood pondering whether he ought not to follow Miss Mowbray
towards Shaws-Castle, in order to be satisfied that no accident had
befallen her on the road, he heard the tread of a horse's feet advancing
hastily in the same direction, leading from the hotel. Unwilling to be
observed at this moment, he stepped aside under shelter of the
underwood, and presently afterwards saw Mr. Mowbray of St. Ronan's,
followed by a groom, ride hastily past his lurking-place, and pursue the
same road which had been just taken by his sister. The presence of her
brother seemed to assure Miss Mowbray's safety, and so removed Tyrrel's
chief reason for following her. Involved in deep and melancholy
reflection upon what had passed, nearly satisfied that his longer
residence in Clara's vicinity could only add to her unhappiness and his
own, yet unable to tear himself from that neighbourhood, or to
relinquish fe<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_146" id="vol_i_Page_146">[Pg&nbsp;146]</a></span>elings which had become entwined with his heart-strings, he
returned to his lodgings in the Aultoun, in a state of mind very little
to be envied.</p>

<p>Tyrrel, on entering his apartment, found that it was not lighted, nor
were the Abigails of Mrs. Dods quite so alert as a waiter at Long's
might have been, to supply him with candles. Unapt at any time to exact
much personal attendance, and desirous to shun at that moment the
necessity of speaking to any person whatever, even on the most trifling
subject, he walked down into the kitchen to supply himself with what he
wanted. He did not at first observe that Mrs. Dods herself was present
in this the very centre of her empire, far less that a lofty air of
indignation was seated on the worthy matron's brow. At first it only
vented itself in broken soliloquy and interjections; as, for example,
&ldquo;Vera bonny wark this!&mdash;vera creditable wark, indeed!&mdash;a decent house to
be disturbed at these hours&mdash;Keep a public&mdash;as weel keep a bedlam!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Finding these murmurs attracted no attention, the dame placed herself
betwixt her guest and the door, to which he was now retiring with his
lighted candle, and demanded of him what was the meaning of such
behaviour.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of what behaviour, madam?&rdquo; said her guest, repeating her question in a
tone of sternness and impatience so unusual with him, that perhaps she
was sorry at the moment that she had provoked him out of his usual
patient indifference; nay, she might even feel intimidated at the
altercation she had provoked, for the resentment of a quiet and patient
person has always in it something formidable to the professed and
habitual grumbler. But her pride w<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_147" id="vol_i_Page_147">[Pg&nbsp;147]</a></span>as too great to think of a retreat,
after having sounded the signal for contest, and so she continued,
though in a tone somewhat lowered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maister Tirl, I wad but just ask you, that are a man of sense, whether
I hae ony right to take your behaviour weel? Here have you been these
ten days and mair, eating the best, and drinking the best, and taking up
the best room in my house; and now to think of your gaun doun and taking
up with yon idle harebrained cattle at the Waal&mdash;I maun e'en be plain
wi' ye&mdash;I like nane of the fair-fashioned folk that can say My Jo and
think it no; and therefore&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Dods,&rdquo; said Tyrrel, interrupting her, &ldquo;I have no time at present
for trifles. I am obliged to you for your attention while I have been in
your house; but the disposal of my time, here or elsewhere, must be
according to my own ideas of pleasure or business&mdash;If you are tired of
me as a guest, send in your bill to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My bill!&rdquo; said Mrs. Dods; &ldquo;my bill to-morrow! And what for no wait till
Saturday, when it may be cleared atween us, plack and bawbee, as it was
on Saturday last?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;we will talk of it to-morrow, Mrs. Dods&mdash;Good-night.&rdquo; And he
withdrew accordingly.</p>

<p>Luckie Dods stood ruminating for a moment. &ldquo;The deil's in him,&rdquo; she
said, &ldquo;for he winna bide being thrawn. And I think the deil's in me too
for thrawing him, sic a canny lad, and sae gude a customer;&mdash;and I am
judging he has something on his mind&mdash;want of siller it canna be&mdash;I am
sure if I thought that, I wadna care about my small thing.&mdash;But want o'

there's but little on't&mdash;I ken weel eneugh how a customer looks that's

<i>The Devil hath met his Match.</i><br />
</p>


<p>The day of which we last gave the events chanced to be Monday, and two
days therefore intervened betwixt it and that for which the
entertainment was fixed, that was to assemble in the halls of the Lord
of the Manor the flower of the company now at St. Ronan's Well. The
interval was but brief for the preparations necessary on an occasion so
unusual; since the house, though delightfully situated, was in very
indifferent repair, and for years had never received any visitors,
except when some blithe bachelor or fox-hunter shared the hospitality of
Mr. Mowbray; an event which became daily more and more uncommon; for, as
he himself almost lived at the Well, he generally contrived to receive
his companions where it could be done without expense to himself.
Besides, the health of his sister afforded an irresistible apology to
any of those old-fashioned Scottish gentlemen, who might be too apt (in
the<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_150" id="vol_i_Page_150">[Pg&nbsp;150]</a></span> rudeness of more primitive days) to consider a friend's house as
their own. Mr. Mowbray was now, however, to the great delight of all
his companions, nailed down, by invitation given and accepted, and they
looked forward to the accomplishment of his promise, with the eagerness
which the prospect of some entertaining novelty never fails to produce
among idlers.</p>

<p>A good deal of trouble devolved on Mr. Mowbray, and his trusty agent Mr.
Meiklewham, before any thing like decent preparation could be made for
the ensuing entertainment; and they were left to their unassisted
endeavours by Clara, who, during both the Tuesday and Wednesday,
obstinately kept herself secluded; nor could her brother, either by
threats or flattery, extort from her any light concerning her purpose on
the approaching and important Thursday. To do John Mowbray justice, he
loved his sister as much as he was capable of loving any thing but
himself; and when, in several arguments, he had the mortification to
find that she was not to be prevailed on to afford her assistance, he,
without complaint, quietly set himself to do the best he could by his
own unassisted judgment or opinion with regard to the necessary
preparations.</p>

<p>This was not, at present, so easy a task as might be supposed: for
Mowbray was ambitious of that character of <i>ton</i> and elegance, which
masculine faculties alone are seldom capable of attaining on such
momentous occasions. The more solid materials of a collation were indeed
to be obtained for money from the next market-town, and were purchased
accordingly; but he felt it was likely to present the vulgar plenty of a
farmer's feast, instead of the eleg<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_151" id="vol_i_Page_151">[Pg&nbsp;151]</a></span>ant entertainment, which might be
announced in a corner of the county paper, as given by John Mowbray,
Esq. of St. Ronan's, to the gay and fashionable company assembled at
that celebrated spring. There was likely to be all sorts of error and
irregularity in dishing, and in sending up; for Shaws-Castle boasted
neither an accomplished housekeeper, nor a kitchenmaid with a hundred
pair of hands to execute her mandates. All the domestic arrangements
were on the minutest system of economy consistent with ordinary decency,
except in the stables, which were excellent and well kept. But can a
groom of the stables perform the labours of a groom of the chambers? or
can the gamekeeper arrange in tempting order the carcasses of the birds
he has shot, strew them with flowers, and garnish them with piquant
sauces? It would be as reasonable to expect a gallant soldier to act as
undertaker, and conduct the funeral of the enemy he has slain.</p>

<p>In a word, Mowbray talked, and consulted, and advised, and squabbled,
with the deaf cook, and a little old man whom he called the butler,
until he at length perceived so little chance of bringing order out of
confusion, or making the least advantageous impression on such obdurate
understandings as he had to deal with, that he fairly committed the
whole matter of the collation, with two or three hearty curses, to the
charge of the officials principally concerned, and proceeded to take the
state of the furniture and apartments under his consideration.</p>

<p>Here he found himself almost equally helpless; for what male wit is
adequate to the thousand little coquetries practised in such
arrangements? how can masculine eyes judge of the degree of <i>demi-jour</i>
which is<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_152" id="vol_i_Page_152">[Pg&nbsp;152]</a></span> to be admitted into a decorated apartment, or discriminate
where the broad light should be suffered to fall on a tolerable picture,
where it should be excluded, lest the stiff daub of a periwigged
grandsire should become too rigidly prominent? And if men are unfit for
weaving such a fairy web of light and darkness as may best suit
furniture, ornaments, and complexions, how shall they be adequate to the
yet more mysterious office of arranging, while they disarrange, the
various movables in the apartment? so that while all has the air of
negligence and chance, the seats are placed as if they had been
transported by a wish to the spot most suitable for accommodation;
stiffness and confusion are at once avoided, the company are neither
limited to a formal circle of chairs, nor exposed to break their noses
over wandering stools; but the arrangements seem to correspond to what
ought to be the tone of the conversation, easy, without being confused,
and regulated, without being constrained or stiffened.</p>

<p>Then how can a clumsy male wit attempt the arrangement of all the
<i>chiffonerie</i>, by which old snuff-boxes, heads of canes, pomander boxes,
lamer beads, and all the trash usually found in the pigeon-holes of the
bureaus of old-fashioned ladies, may be now brought into play, by
throwing them, carelessly grouped with other unconsidered trifles, such
as are to be seen in the windows of a pawnbroker's shop, upon a marble
<i>encognure</i>, or a mosaic work-table, thereby turning to advantage the
trash and trinketry, which all the old maids or magpies, who have
inhabited the mansion for a century, have contrived to accumulate. With
what admiration of the ingenuity of the fair artist have I sometimes
pried into the<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_153" id="vol_i_Page_153">[Pg&nbsp;153]</a></span>se miscellaneous groups of <i>pseudo-bijouterie</i>, and seen
the great grandsire's thumb-ring couchant with the coral and bells of
the first-born&mdash;and the boatswain's whistle of some old naval uncle, or
his silver tobacco-box, redolent of Oroonoko, happily grouped with the
mother's ivory comb-case, still odorous of musk, and with some virgin
aunt's tortoise-shell spectacle-case, and the eagle's talon of ebony,
with which, in the days of long and stiff stays, our grandmothers were
wont to alleviate any little irritation in their back or shoulders! Then
there was the silver strainer, on which, in more economical times than
ours, the lady of the house placed the tea-leaves, after the very last
drop had been exhausted, that they might afterwards be hospitably
divided among the company, to be eaten with sugar, and with bread and
butter. Blessings upon a fashion which has rescued from the claws of
abigails, and the melting-pot of the silversmith, those neglected
<i>cimelia</i>, for the benefit of antiquaries and the decoration of
side-tables! But who shall presume to place them there, unless under the
direction of female taste? and of that Mr. Mowbray, though possessed of
a large stock of such treasures, was for the present entirely deprived.</p>

<p>This digression upon his difficulties is already too long, or I might
mention the Laird's inexperience in the art of making the worse appear
the better garnishment, of hiding a darned carpet with a new
floor-cloth, and flinging an Indian shawl over a faded and threadbare
sofa. But I have said enough, and more than enough, to explain his
dilemma to an unassisted bachelor, who, without mother, sister, or
cousin, without skilful housekeeper, or experienced clerk of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_154" id="vol_i_Page_154">[Pg&nbsp;154]</a></span>
kitchen, or valet of parts and figure, adventures to give an
entertainment, and aspires to make it elegant and <i>comme il faut</i>.</p>

<p>The sense of his insufficiency was the more vexatious to Mowbray, as he
was aware he would find sharp critics in the ladies, and particularly in
his constant rival, Lady Penelope Penfeather. He was, therefore,
incessant in his exertions; and for two whole days ordered and
disordered, demanded, commanded, countermanded, and reprimanded, without
pause or cessation. The companion, for he could not be termed an
assistant, of his labours, was his trusty agent, who trotted from room
to room after him, affording him exactly the same degree of sympathy
which a dog doth to his master when distressed in mind, by looking in
his face from time to time with a piteous gaze, as if to assure him that
he partakes of his trouble, though he neither comprehends the cause or
the extent of it, nor has in the slightest degree the power to remove
it.</p>

<p>At length when Mowbray had got some matters arranged to his mind, and
abandoned a great many which he would willingly have put in better
order, he sat down to dinner upon the Wednesday preceding the appointed
day, with his worthy aide-de-camp, Mr. Meiklewham; and after bestowing a
few muttered curses upon the whole concern, and the fantastic old maid
who had brought him into the scrape, by begging an invitation, declared
that all things might now go to the devil their own way, for so sure as
his name was John Mowbray, he would trouble himself no more about them.</p>

<p>Keeping this doughty resolution, he sat down to dinner with his counsel
learned in the law; and speedily they dispatched the dish of chops which
was set before them, and the better part of the bottle of old port,
which served for its menstruum.<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_155" id="vol_i_Page_155">[Pg&nbsp;155]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;We are well enough now,&rdquo; said Mowbray, &ldquo;though we have had none of
their d&mdash;&mdash;d kickshaws.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A wamefou' is a wamefou',&rdquo; said the writer, swabbing his greasy chops,
&ldquo;whether it be of the barleymeal or the bran.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A cart-horse thinks so,&rdquo; said Mowbray; &ldquo;but we must do as others do,
and gentlemen and ladies are of a different opinion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The waur for themselves and the country baith, St. Ronan's&mdash;it's the
jinketing and the jirbling wi' tea and wi' trumpery that brings our
nobles to nine-pence, and mony a het ha'-house to a hired lodging in the
Abbey.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The young gentleman paused for a few minutes&mdash;filled a bumper, and
pushed the bottle to the senior&mdash;then said abruptly, &ldquo;Do you believe in
luck, Mick?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In luck?&rdquo; answered the attorney; &ldquo;what do you mean by the question?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, because I believe in luck myself&mdash;in a good or bad run of luck at
cards.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You wad have mair luck the day, if you had never touched them,&rdquo; replied
his confident.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is not the question now,&rdquo; said Mowbray; &ldquo;but what I wonder at is
the wretched chance that has attended us miserable Lairds of St. Ronan's
for more than a hundred years, that we have always been getting worse in
the world, and never better. Never has there been such a backsliding
generation, as the parson would say&mdash;half the country once belonged to
my ancestors, and now the last furrows of it seem to be flying.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fle<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_156" id="vol_i_Page_156">[Pg&nbsp;156]</a></span>eing!&rdquo; said the writer, &ldquo;they are barking and fleeing baith.&mdash;This
Shaws-Castle here, I'se warrant it flee up the chimney after the rest,
were it not weel fastened down with your grandfather's tailzie.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Damn the tailzie!&rdquo; said Mowbray; &ldquo;if they had meant to keep up their
estate, they should have entailed it when it was worth keeping: to tie a
man down to such an insignificant thing as St. Ronan's, is like
tethering a horse on six roods of a Highland moor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye have broke weel in on the mailing by your feus down at the Well,&rdquo;
said Meiklewham, &ldquo;and raxed ower the tether maybe a wee bit farther than
ye had ony right to do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was by your advice, was it not?&rdquo; said the Laird.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'se ne'er deny it, St. Ronan's,&rdquo; answered the writer; &ldquo;but I am such a
gude-natured guse, that I just set about pleasing you as an auld wife
pleases a bairn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; said the man of pleasure, &ldquo;when she reaches it a knife to cut its
own fingers with.&mdash;These acres would have been safe enough, if it had
not been for your d&mdash;&mdash;d advice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And yet you were grumbling e'en now,&rdquo; said the man of business, &ldquo;that
you have not the power to gar the whole estate flee like a wild-duck
across a bog? Troth, you need care little about it; for if you have
incurred an irritancy&mdash;and sae thinks Mr. Wisebehind, the advocate, upon
an A. B. memorial that I laid before him&mdash;your sister, or your sister's
goodman, if she should take the fancy to marry, might bring a
declarator, and evict St. Ronan's frae ye in the course of twa or three
sessions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My sister will never marry,&rdquo; said John Mowbra<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_157" id="vol_i_Page_157">[Pg&nbsp;157]</a></span>y.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That's easily said,&rdquo; replied the writer; &ldquo;but as broken a ship's come
to land. If ony body kend o' the chance she has o' the estate, there's
mony a weel-doing man would think little of the bee in her bonnet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Harkye, Mr. Meiklewham,&rdquo; said the Laird, &ldquo;I will be obliged to you if
you will speak of Miss Mowbray with the respect due to her father's
daughter, and my sister.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nae offence, St. Ronan's, nae offence,&rdquo; answered the man of law; &ldquo;but
ilka man maun speak sae as to be understood,&mdash;that is, when he speaks
about business. Ye ken yoursell, that Miss Clara is no just like other
folk; and were I you&mdash;it's my duty to speak plain&mdash;I wad e'en gie in a
bit scroll of a petition to the Lords, to be appointed Curator Bonis, in
respect of her incapacity to manage her own affairs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Meiklewham,&rdquo; said Mowbray, &ldquo;you are a&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;and then stopped short.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What am I, Mr. Mowbray?&rdquo; said Meiklewham, somewhat sternly&mdash;&ldquo;What am I?
I wad be glad to ken what I am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A very good lawyer, I dare say,&rdquo; replied St. Ronan's, who was too much
in the power of his agent to give way to his first impulse. &ldquo;But I must
tell you, that rather than take such a measure against poor Clara, as
you recommend, I would give her up the estate, and become an ostler or a
postilion for the rest of my life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, St. Ronan's,&rdquo; said the man of law, &ldquo;if you had wished to keep up
the auld house, you should have taken another trade, than to become an
ostler <span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_158" id="vol_i_Page_158">[Pg&nbsp;158]</a></span>or a postilion. What ailed you, man, but to have been a lawyer as
weel as other folk? My auld Maister had a wee bit Latin about <i>rerum
dominos gentemque togatam</i>, whilk signified, he said, that all lairds
should be lawyers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All lawyers are likely to become lairds, I think,&rdquo; replied Mowbray;
&ldquo;they purchase our acres by the thousand, and pay us, according to the
old story, with a multiplepoinding, as your learned friends call it, Mr.
Meiklewham.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Weel&mdash;and mightna you have purchased as weel as other folk?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not I,&rdquo; replied the Laird; &ldquo;I have no turn for that service, I should
only have wasted bombazine on my shoulders, and flour upon my
three-tailed wig&mdash;should but have lounged away my mornings in the
Outer-House, and my evenings at the play-house, and acquired no more law
than what would have made me a wise justice at a Small-debt Court.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you gained little, you would have lost as little,&rdquo; said Meiklewham;
&ldquo;and albeit ye were nae great gun at the bar, ye might aye have gotten a
Sheriffdom, or a Commissaryship, amang the lave, to keep the banes
green; and sae ye might have saved your estate from deteriorating, if ye
didna mend it muckle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, but I could not have had the chance of doubling it, as I might
have done,&rdquo; answered Mowbray, &ldquo;had that inconstant jade, Fortune, but
stood a moment faithful to me. I tell you, Mick, that I have been,
within this twelvemonth, worth a hundred thousand&mdash;worth fifty
thousand&mdash;worth nothing, but the remnant of this wretched estate, which
is too little to do one good while it is mine, though, were it sold, I
could start again, and mend my hand a little.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_159" id="vol_i_Page_159">[Pg&nbsp;159]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay, just fling the helve after the hatchet,&rdquo; said his legal
adviser&mdash;&ldquo;that's a' you think of. What signifies winning a hundred
thousand pounds, if you win them to lose them a' again?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What signifies it?&rdquo; replied Mowbray. &ldquo;Why, it signifies as much to a
man of spirit, as having won a battle signifies to a general&mdash;no matter
that he is beaten afterwards in his turn, he knows there is luck for him
as well as others, and so he has spirit to try it again. Here is the
young Earl of Etherington will be amongst us in a day or two&mdash;they say
he is up to every thing&mdash;if I had but five hundred to begin with, I
should be soon up to him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Mowbray,&rdquo; said Meiklewham, &ldquo;I am sorry for ye. I have been your
house's man-of-business&mdash;I may say, in some measure, your house's
servant&mdash;and now I am to see an end of it all, and just by the lad that
I thought maist likely to set it up again better than ever; for, to do
ye justice, you have aye had an ee to your ain interest, sae far as your
lights gaed. It brings tears into my auld een.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never weep for the matter, Mick,&rdquo; answered Mowbray; &ldquo;some of it will
stick, my old boy, in your pockets, if not in mine&mdash;your service will
not be altogether gratuitous, my old friend&mdash;the labourer is worthy of
his hire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Weel I wot is he,&rdquo; said the writer; &ldquo;but double fees would hardly carry
folk through some wark. But if ye will have siller, ye maun have
siller&mdash;but, I warrant, it goes just where the rest gaed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, by twenty devils!&rdquo; exclaimed Mowbray, &ldquo;to f<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_160" id="vol_i_Page_160">[Pg&nbsp;160]</a></span>ail this time is
impossible&mdash;Jack Wolverine was too strong for Etherington at any thing
he could name; and I can beat Wolverine from the Land's-End to Johnnie
Groat's&mdash;but there must be something to go upon&mdash;the blunt must be had,
Mick.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very likely&mdash;nae doubt&mdash;that is always provided it <i>can</i> be had,&rdquo;
answered the legal adviser.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That's your business, my old cock,&rdquo; said Mowbray. &ldquo;This youngster will
be here perhaps to-morrow, with money in both pockets&mdash;he takes up his
rents as he comes down, Mick&mdash;think of that, my old friend.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Weel for them that have rents to take up,&rdquo; said Meiklewham; &ldquo;ours are
lying rather ower low to be lifted at present.&mdash;But are you sure this
Earl is a man to mell with?&mdash;are you sure ye can win of him, and that if
you do, he can pay his losings, Mr. Mowbray?&mdash;because I have kend mony
are come for wool, and gang hame shorn; and though ye are a clever young
gentleman, and I am bound to suppose ye ken as much about life as most
folk, and all that; yet some gate or other ye have aye come off at the
losing hand, as ye have ower much reason to ken this day&mdash;howbeit&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, the devil take your gossip, my dear Mick! If you can give no help,
spare drowning me with your pother.&mdash;Why, man, I was a fresh hand&mdash;had
my apprentice-fees to pay&mdash;and these are no trifles, Mick.&mdash;But what of
that?&mdash;I am free of the company now, and can trade on my own bottom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aweel, aweel, I wish it may be sae,&rdquo; said Meiklewham.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will be so, and it shall be so, my trusty friend,&rdquo; replied Mowbray,
cheerily, &ldquo;so you will but help me to the stock to trade with.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_161" id="vol_i_Page_161">[Pg&nbsp;161]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;The stock?&mdash;what d'ye ca' the stock? I ken nae stock that ye have
left.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But <i>you</i> have plenty, my old boy&mdash;Come, sell out a few of your three
per cents; I will pay difference&mdash;interest&mdash;exchange&mdash;every thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay&mdash;every thing or naething,&rdquo; answered Meiklewham; &ldquo;but as you are
sae very pressing, I hae been thinking&mdash;Whan is the siller wanted?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This instant&mdash;this day&mdash;to-morrow at farthest!&rdquo; exclaimed the proposed
borrower.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wh&mdash;ew!&rdquo; whistled the lawyer, with a long prolongation of the note;
&ldquo;the thing is impossible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It must be, Mick, for all that,&rdquo; answered Mr. Mowbray, who knew by
experience that <i>impossible</i>, when uttered by his accommodating friend
in this tone, meant only, when interpreted, extremely difficult, and
very expensive.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then it must be by Miss Clara selling her stock, now that ye speak of
stock,&rdquo; said Meiklewham; &ldquo;I wonder ye didna think of this before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish you had been dumb rather than that you had mentioned it now,&rdquo;
said Mowbray, starting, as if stung by an adder&mdash;&ldquo;What, Clara's
pittance!&mdash;the trifle my aunt left her for her own fanciful
expenses&mdash;her own little private store, that she puts to so many good
purposes&mdash;Poor Clara, that has so little!&mdash;And why not rather your own,
Master Meiklewham, who call yourself the friend and servant of our
family?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, St. Ronan's,&rdquo; answered Meiklewham, &ldquo;that is a' very true&mdash;but
service is nae inheritance; and as for friendship, it begins at hame, as
wise folk have said lang before our time. And for that matter, I <span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_162" id="vol_i_Page_162">[Pg&nbsp;162]</a></span>think
they that are nearest sib should take maist risk. You are nearer and
dearer to your sister, St. Ronan's, than you are to poor Saunders
Meiklewham, that hasna sae muckle gentle blood as would supper up an
hungry flea.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will not do this,&rdquo; said St. Ronan's, walking up and down with much
agitation; for, selfish as he was, he loved his sister, and loved her
the more on account of those peculiarities which rendered his protection
indispensable to her comfortable existence&mdash;&ldquo;I will not,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;pillage her, come on't what will. I will rather go a volunteer to the
continent, and die like a gentleman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He continued to pace the room in a moody silence, which began to disturb
his companion, who had not been hitherto accustomed to see his patron
take matters so deeply. At length he made an attempt to attract the
attention of the silent and sullen ponderer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Mowbray&rdquo;&mdash;no answer&mdash;&ldquo;I was saying, St. Ronan's&rdquo;&mdash;still no reply.
&ldquo;I have been thinking about this matter&mdash;and&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And <i>what</i>, sir?&rdquo; said St. Ronan's, stopping short, and speaking in a
stern tone of voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And, to speak truth, I see little feasibility in the matter ony way;
for if ye had the siller in your pocket to-day, it would be a' in the
Earl of Etherington's the morn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pshaw! you are a fool,&rdquo; answered Mowbray.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is not unlikely,&rdquo; said Meiklewham; &ldquo;but so is Sir Bingo Binks, and
yet he's had the better of you, St. Ronan's, this twa or three times.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is false!&mdash;he has not,&rdquo; answered St. Ronan's, fiercely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Weel I wot,&rdquo; resumed Meiklewham, &ldquo;he took you in about the saumon fish,
and some other wager ye lost to him this very day.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_163" id="vol_i_Page_163">[Pg&nbsp;163]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you once more, Meiklewham, you are a fool, and no more up to my
trim than you are to the longitude.&mdash;Bingo is got shy&mdash;I must give him
a little line, that is all&mdash;then I shall strike him to purpose&mdash;I am as
sure of him as I am of the other&mdash;I know the fly they will both rise
to&mdash;this cursed want of five hundred will do me out of ten thousand!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you are so certain of being the bangster&mdash;so very certain, I mean,
of sweeping stakes,&mdash;what harm will Miss Clara come to by your having
the use of her siller? You can make it up to her for the risk ten times
told.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And so I can, by Heaven!&rdquo; said St. Ronan's. &ldquo;Mick, you are right, and I
am a scrupulous, chicken-hearted fool. Clara shall have a thousand for
her poor five hundred&mdash;she shall, by &mdash;&mdash;. And I will carry her to
Edinburgh for a season, or perhaps to London, and we will have the best
advice for her case, and the best company to divert her. And if they
think her a little odd&mdash;why, d&mdash;&mdash; me, I am her brother, and will bear
her through it. Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;you're right; there can be no hurt in
borrowing five hundred of her for a few days, when such profit may be
made on't, both for her and me.&mdash;Here, fill the glasses, my old boy, and
drink success to it, for you are right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here is success to it, with all my heart,&rdquo; answered Meiklewham,
heartily glad to see his patron's sanguine temper arrive at this
desirable conclusion, and yet willing to hedge in his own credit; &ldquo;but
it is <i>you</i> are right, and not <i>me</i>, for I advise nothing except on your
assurances, that you can make your ain of this English ear<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_164" id="vol_i_Page_164">[Pg&nbsp;164]</a></span>l, and of this
Sir Bingo&mdash;and if you can but do that, I am sure it would be unwise and
unkind in ony ane of your friends to stand in your light.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;True, Mick, true,&rdquo; answered Mowbray.&mdash;&ldquo;And yet dice and cards are but
bones and pasteboard, and the best horse ever started may slip a
shoulder before he get to the winning-post&mdash;and so I wish Clara's
venture had not been in such a bottom.&mdash;But, hang it, care killed a
cat&mdash;I can hedge as well as any one, if the odds turn up against me&mdash;so
let us have the cash, Mick.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aha! but there go two words to that bargain&mdash;the stock stands in my
name, and Tam Turnpenny the banker's, as trustees for Miss Clara&mdash;Now,
get you her letter to us, desiring us to sell out and to pay you the
proceeds, and Tam Turnpenny will let you have five hundred pounds
<i>instanter</i>, on the faith of the transaction; for I fancy you would
desire a' the stock to be sold out, and it will produce more than six
hundred, or seven hundred pounds either&mdash;and I reckon you will be
selling out the whole&mdash;it's needless making twa bites of a cherry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; answered Mowbray; &ldquo;since we must be rogues, or something like
it, let us make it worth our while at least; so give me a form of the
letter, and Clara shall copy it&mdash;that is, if she consents; for you know
she can keep her own opinion as well as any other woman in the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And that,&rdquo; said Meiklewham, &ldquo;is as the wind will keep its way, preach
to it as ye like. But if I might advise about Miss Clara&mdash;I wad say
naething mair than that I was stressed for the penny money; for I
mistake her muckle if she would <span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_165" id="vol_i_Page_165">[Pg&nbsp;165]</a></span>like to see you ganging to pitch and
toss wi' this lord and tither baronet for her aunt's three per cents&mdash;I
ken she has some queer notions&mdash;she gies away the feck of the dividends
on that very stock in downright charity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I am in hazard to rob the poor as well as my sister!&rdquo; said Mowbray,
filling once more his own glass and his friend's. &ldquo;Come, Mick, no
sky-lights&mdash;here is Clara's health&mdash;she is an angel&mdash;and I am&mdash;what I
will not call myself, and suffer no other man to call me.&mdash;But I shall
win this time&mdash;I am sure I shall, since Clara's fortune depends upon
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, I think, on the other hand,&rdquo; said Meiklewham, &ldquo;that if any thing
should chance wrang, (and Heaven kens that the best-laid schemes will
gang ajee,) it will be a great comfort to think that the ultimate losers
will only be the poor folk, that have the parish between them and
absolute starvation&mdash;if your sister spent her ain siller, it would be a
very different story.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush, Mick&mdash;for God's sake, hush, mine honest friend,&rdquo; said Mowbray;
&ldquo;it is quite true; thou art a rare counsellor in time of need, and hast
as happy a manner of reconciling a man's conscience with his
necessities, as might set up a score of casuists; but beware, my most
zealous counsellor and confessor, how you drive the nail too far&mdash;I
promise you some of the chaffing you are at just now rather abates my
pluck.&mdash;Well&mdash;give me your scroll&mdash;I will to C<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_166" id="vol_i_Page_166">[Pg&nbsp;166]</a></span>lara with it&mdash;though I
would rather meet the best shot in Britain, with ten paces of green sod
betwixt us.&rdquo; So saying, he left the apartment.</p>

<p>When Mowbray had left his dangerous adviser, in order to steer the
course which his agent had indicated, without offering to recommend it,
he went to the little parlour which his sister was wont to term her own,
and in which she spent great part of her time. It was fitted up with a
sort of fanciful neatness; and in its perfect arrangement and good
order, formed a strong contrast to the other apartments of the old and
neglected mansion-house. A number of little articles lay on the
work-table, indicating the elegant, and, at the same time, the unsettled
turn of the inhabitant's mind. There were unfinished drawings, blotted
music, needlework of various kinds, and many other little<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_167" id="vol_i_Page_167">[Pg&nbsp;167]</a></span> female tasks;
all undertaken with zeal, and so far prosecuted with art and elegance,
but all flung aside before any one of them was completed.</p>

<p>Clara herself sat upon a little low couch by the window, reading, or at
least turning over the leaves of a book, in which she seemed to read.
But instantly starting up when she saw her brother, she ran towards him
with the most cordial cheerfulness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Welcome, welcome, my dear John; this is very kind of you to come to
visit your recluse sister. I have been trying to nail my eyes and my
understanding to a stupid book here, because they say too much thought
is not quite good for me. But, either the man's dulness, or my want of
the power of attending, makes my eyes pass over the page, just as one
seems to read in a dream, without being able to comprehend one word of
the matter. You shall talk to me, and that will do better. What can I
give you to show that you are welcome? I am afraid tea is all I have to
offer, and that you set too little store by.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall be glad of a cup at present,&rdquo; said Mowbray, &ldquo;for I wish to
speak with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then Jessy shall make it ready instantly,&rdquo; said Miss Mowbray, ringing,
and giving orders to her waiting-maid&mdash;&ldquo;but you must not be ungrateful,
John, and plague me with any of the ceremonial for your
f&ecirc;te&mdash;&lsquo;sufficient for the day is the evil thereof.&rsquo; I will attend, and
play my part as prettily as you can desire; but to think of it
beforehand, would make both my head and my heart ache; and so I beg you
will spare me on the subject.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, you wild kitten,&rdquo; said Mowbray, &ldquo;you turn every day more shy of
human communication&mdash;we shal<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_168" id="vol_i_Page_168">[Pg&nbsp;168]</a></span>l have you take the woods one day, and
become as savage as the Princess Caraboo. But I will plague you about
nothing if I can help it. If matters go not smooth on the great day,
they must e'en blame the dull thick head that had no fair lady to help
him in his need. But, Clara, I had something more material to say to
you&mdash;something indeed of the last importance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; said Clara, in a tone of voice approaching to a
scream&mdash;&ldquo;in the name of God, what is it? You know not how you terrify
me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, you start at a shadow, Clara,&rdquo; answered her brother. &ldquo;It is no
such uncommon matter neither&mdash;good faith, it is the most common distress
in the world, so far as I know the world&mdash;I am sorely pinched for
money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that all?&rdquo; replied Clara, in a tone which seemed to her brother as
much to underrate the difficulty, when it was explained, as her fears
had exaggerated it before she heard its nature.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that all? Indeed it is all, and comprehends a great deal of
vexation. I shall be hard run unless I can get a certain sum of
money&mdash;and I must e'en ask you if you can help me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Help you?&rdquo; replied Clara; &ldquo;Yes, with all my heart&mdash;but you know my
purse is a light one&mdash;more than half of my last dividend is in it,
however, and I am sure, John, I shall be happy if it can serve
you&mdash;especially as that will at least show that your wants are but small
ones.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alas, Clara, if you would help me,&rdquo; said her brother, half repentant of
his purpose, &ldquo;you must draw the neck of the goose which lays the golden
eggs&mdash;you must lend me the whole stock.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And why not, John,&rdquo; said the simple-hear<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_169" id="vol_i_Page_169">[Pg&nbsp;169]</a></span>ted girl, &ldquo;if it will do you a
kindness? Are you not my natural guardian? Are you not a kind one? And
is not my little fortune entirely at your disposal? You will, I am
sure, do all for the best.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I fear I may not,&rdquo; said Mowbray, starting from her, and more distressed
by her sudden and unsuspicious compliance, than he would have been by
difficulties, or remonstrance. In the latter case, he would have stifled
the pangs of conscience amid the man&oelig;uvres which he must have
resorted to for obtaining her acquiescence; as matters stood, there was
all the difference that there is between slaughtering a tame and
unresisting animal, and pursuing wild game, until the animation of the
sportsman's exertions overcomes the internal sense of his own
cruelty.<a name="vol_i_FNanchor_E_28" id="vol_i_FNanchor_E_28"></a><a href="#vol_i_Footnote_E_28" class="fnanchor">[E]</a> The same idea occurred to Mowbray himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By G&mdash;,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;this is like shooting the bird sitting.&mdash;Clara,&rdquo; he
added, &ldquo;I fear this money will scarce be employed as you would wish.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Employ it as you yourself please, my dearest brother,&rdquo; she replied,
&ldquo;and I will believe it is all for the best.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, I am doing for the best,&rdquo; he replied; &ldquo;at least, I am doing what
must be done, for I see no other way through it&mdash;so all you have to do
is to copy this paper, and bid adieu to bank dividends&mdash;for a little
while at least. I trust soon to double this little matter for you, if
Fortune will but stand my friend.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do not trust to Fortune, John,&rdquo; said Clara, smiling, though with an
expression of deep melancholy. &ldquo;Alas! she has never been a friend to our
family&mdash;not at least for many a day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She favours<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_170" id="vol_i_Page_170">[Pg&nbsp;170]</a></span> the bold, say my old grammatical exercises,&rdquo; answered her
brother; &ldquo;and I must trust her, were she as changeable as a
weathercock.&mdash;And yet&mdash;if she should jilt me!&mdash;What will you do&mdash;what
will you say, Clara, if I am unable, contrary to my hope, trust, and
expectation, to repay you this money within a short time?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do?&rdquo; replied Clara; &ldquo;I must do without it, you know; and for saying, I
will not say a word.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; replied Mowbray, &ldquo;but your little expenses&mdash;your charities&mdash;your
halt and blind&mdash;your round of paupers?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I can manage all that too. Look you here, John, how many
half-worked trifles there are. The needle or the pencil is the resource
of all distressed heroines, you know; and I promise you, though I have
been a little idle and unsettled of late, yet, when I do set about it,
no Emmeline or Ethelinde of them all ever sent such loads of trumpery to
market as I shall, or made such wealth as I will do. I dare say Lady
Penelope, and all the gentry at the Well, will purchase, and will
raffle, and do all sort of things to encourage the pensive performer. I
will send them such lots of landscapes with sap-green trees, and
mazareen-blue rivers, and portraits that will terrify the originals
themselves&mdash;and handkerchiefs and turbans, with needlework scallopped
exactly like the walks on the Belvidere&mdash;Why, I shall become a little
fortune in the first season.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Clara,&rdquo; said John, gravely, for a virtuous resolution had gained
the upperhand in his bosom, while his sister ran on in this manner,&mdash;&ldquo;We
will do something better than all this. If this kind help of yours does
not fetch me through, I am determined I will cut <span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_171" id="vol_i_Page_171">[Pg&nbsp;171]</a></span>the whole concern. It
is but standing a laugh or two, and hearing a gay fellow say, D&mdash;&mdash; me,
Jack, are you turned clodhopper at last?&mdash;that is the worst. Dogs,
horses, and all, shall go to the hammer; we will keep nothing but your
pony, and I will trust to a pair of excellent legs. There is enough left
of the old acres to keep us in the way you like best, and that I will
learn to like. I will work in the garden, and work in the forest, mark
my own trees, and cut them myself, keep my own accounts, and send
Saunders Meiklewham to the devil.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That last is the best resolution of all, John,&rdquo; said Clara; &ldquo;and if
such a day should come round, I should be the happiest of living
creatures&mdash;I should not have a grief left in the world&mdash;if I had, you
should never see or hear of it&mdash;it should lie here,&rdquo; she said, pressing
her hand on her bosom, &ldquo;buried as deep as a funereal urn in a cold
sepulchre. Oh! could we not begin such a life to-morrow? If it is
absolutely necessary that this trifle of money should be got rid of
first, throw it into the river, and think you have lost it amongst
gamblers and horse-jockeys.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Clara's eyes, which she fondly fixed on her brother's face, glowed
through the tears which her enthusiasm called into them, while she thus
addressed him. Mowbray, on his part, kept his looks fixed on the ground,
with a flush on his cheek, that expressed at once false pride and real
shame.</p>

<p>At length he looked up:&mdash;&ldquo;My dear girl,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;how foolishly you
talk, and how foolishly I, that have twenty things to do, stand here
listening to you! All will go smooth on <i>my</i> plan&mdash;if it should not, we
have yours in reserve, and I swear to you I will<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_172" id="vol_i_Page_172">[Pg&nbsp;172]</a></span> adopt it. The trifle
which this letter of yours enables me to command, may have luck in it,
and we must not throw up the cards while we have a chance of the
game.&mdash;Were I to cut from this moment, these few hundreds would make us
little better or little worse&mdash;so you see we have two strings to our
bow. Luck is sometimes against me, that is true&mdash;but upon true
principle, and playing on the square, I can manage the best of them, or
my name is not Mowbray. Adieu, my dearest Clara.&rdquo; So saying, he kissed
her cheek with a more than usual degree of affection.</p>

<p>Ere he could raise himself from his stooping posture, she threw her arm
kindly over his neck, and said with a tone of the deepest interest, &ldquo;My
dearest brother, your slightest wish has been, and ever shall be, a law
to me&mdash;Oh! if you would but grant me one request in return!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it, you silly girl?&rdquo; said Mowbray, gently disengaging himself
from her hold.&mdash;&ldquo;What is it you can have to ask that needs such a solemn
preface?&mdash;Remember, I hate prefaces; and when I happen to open a book,
always skip them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Without preface, then, my dearest brother, will you, for my sake, avoid
those quarrels in which the people yonder are eternally engaged? I never
go down there but I hear of some new brawl; and I never lay my head down
to sleep, but I dream that you are the victim of it. Even last
night&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, Clara, if you begin to tell your dreams, we shall never have done.
Sleeping, to be sure, is the most serious employment of your life&mdash;for
as to eating, you hardly match a sparrow; but I entreat you to sleep
without dreaming, or to keep your visions to yourself.&mdash;Why do you keep
such fast hold o<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_173" id="vol_i_Page_173">[Pg&nbsp;173]</a></span>f me?&mdash;What on earth can you be afraid of?&mdash;Surely you
do not think the blockhead Binks, or any other of the good folks below
yonder, dared to turn on me? Egad, I wish they would pluck up a little
mettle, that I might have an excuse for drilling them. Gad, I would soon
teach them to follow at heel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, John,&rdquo; replied his sister; &ldquo;it is not of such men as these that I
have any fear&mdash;and yet, cowards are sometimes driven to desperation, and
become more dangerous than better men&mdash;but it is not such as these that
I fear. But there are men in the world whose qualities are beyond their
seeming&mdash;whose spirit and courage lie hidden, like metals in the mine,
under an unmarked or a plain exterior.&mdash;You may meet with such&mdash;you are
rash and headlong, and apt to exercise your wit without always weighing
consequences, and thus&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;On my word, Clara,&rdquo; answered Mowbray, &ldquo;you are in a most sermonizing
humour this morning! the parson himself could not have been more logical
or profound. You have only to divide your discourse into heads, and
garnish it with conclusions for use, and conclusions for doctrine, and
it might be preached before a whole presbytery, with every chance of
instruction and edification. But I am a man of the world, my little
Clara; and though I wish to go in death's way as little as possible, I
must not fear the raw-head and bloody-bones neither.&mdash;And who the devil
is to put the question to me?&mdash;I must know that, Clara, for you have
some especial person in your eye when you bid me take care of
quarrelling.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Clara could not become paler than was her usual complexion; but her
voice faltered as she eagerly assured her brother, that she had no
particular person in her thoughts.<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_174" id="vol_i_Page_174">[Pg&nbsp;174]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Clara,&rdquo; said her brother, &ldquo;do you remember, when there was a report of
a bogle<a name="vol_i_FNanchor_17_17" id="vol_i_FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#vol_i_Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> in the upper orchard, when we were both children?&mdash;Do you
remember how you were perpetually telling me to take care of the bogle,
and keep away from its haunts?&mdash;And do you remember my going on purpose
to detect the bogle, finding the cow-boy, with a shirt about him, busied
in pulling pears, and treating him to a handsome drubbing?&mdash;I am the
same Jack Mowbray still, as ready to face danger, and unmask imposition;
and your fears, Clara, will only make me watch more closely, till I find
out the real object of them. If you warn me of quarrelling with some
one, it must be because you know some one who is not unlikely to quarrel
with me. You are a flighty and fanciful girl, but you have sense enough
not to trouble either yourself or me on a point of honour, save when
there is some good reason for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Clara once more protested, and it was with the deepest anxiety to be
believed, that what she had said arose only out of the general
consequences which she apprehended from the line of conduct her brother
had adopted, and which, in her apprehension, was so likely to engage him
in the broils that divided the good company at the Spring. Mowbray
listened to her explanation with an air of doubt, or rather incredulity,
sipped a cup of tea which had for some time been placed before him, and
at length replied, &ldquo;Well, Clara, whether I am right or wrong in my
guess, it would be cruel to torment you any more, remembering what you
have just done for me. But do justice to your brother, and believe, th<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_175" id="vol_i_Page_175">[Pg&nbsp;175]</a></span>at
when you have any thing to ask of him, an explicit declaration of your
wishes will answer your purpose much better than any ingenious oblique
attempts to influence me. Give up all thoughts of such, my dear
Clara&mdash;you are but a poor man&oelig;uvrer, but were you the very Machiavel
of your sex, you should not turn the flank of John Mowbray.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He left the room as he spoke, and did not return, though his sister
twice called upon him. It is true that she uttered the word brother so
faintly, that perhaps the sound did not reach his ears.&mdash;&ldquo;He is gone,&rdquo;
she said, &ldquo;and I have had no power to speak out! I am like the wretched
creatures, who, it is said, lie under a potent charm, that prevents them
alike from sheddi<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_176" id="vol_i_Page_176">[Pg&nbsp;176]</a></span>ng tears and from confessing their crimes&mdash;Yes, there
is a spell on this unhappy heart, and either that must be dissolved, or
this must break.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>THE CHALLENGE.</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>A slight note I have about me, for the delivery of which you must
excuse me. It is an office which friendship calls upon me to do,

<p class="citation">
<i>King and No King.</i><br />
</p>


<p>The intelligent reader may recollect, that Tyrrel departed from the Fox
Hotel on terms not altogether so friendly towards the company as those
under which he entered it. Indeed, it occurred to him, that he might
probably have heard something farther on the subject, though, amidst
matters of deeper and more anxious consideration, the idea only passed
hastily through his mind; and two days having gone over without any
message from Sir Bingo Binks, the whole affair glided entirely out of
his memory.</p>

<p>The truth was, that although never old woman took more trouble to
collect and blow up with her bellows the embers of her decayed fire,
than Captain MacTurk kindly underwent for the purpose of puffing into a
flame the dying sparkles of the Baronet's courage; yet two days were
spent in fruitless conferences before he could attain the desired point.
He found Sir Bingo on these different occasion<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_177" id="vol_i_Page_177">[Pg&nbsp;177]</a></span>s in all sorts of
different moods of mind, and disposed to view the thing in all shades of
light, except what the Captain thought was the true one.&mdash;He was in a
drunken humour&mdash;in a sullen humour&mdash;in a thoughtless and vilipending
humour&mdash;in every humour but a fighting one. And when Captain MacTurk
talked of the reputation of the company at the Well, Sir Bingo pretended
to take offence, said the company might go to the devil, and hinted that
he &ldquo;did them sufficient honour by gracing them with his countenance, but
did not mean to constitute them any judges of his affairs. The fellow
was a raff, and he would have nothing to do with him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Captain MacTurk would willingly have taken measures against the Baronet
himself, as in a state of contumacy, but was opposed by Winterblossom
and other members of the committee, who considered Sir Bingo as too
important and illustrious a member of their society to be rashly
expelled from a place not honoured by the residence of many persons of
rank; and finally insisted that nothing should be done in the matter
without the advice of Mowbray, whose preparations for his solemn
festival on the following Thursday had so much occupied him, that he had
not lately appeared at the Well.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile, the gallant Captain seemed to experience as much
distress of mind, as if some stain had lain on his own most unblemished
of reputations. He went up and down upon the points of his toes, rising
up on his instep with a jerk which at once expressed vexation and
defiance&mdash;He carried his nose turned up in the air, like that of a pig
when he snuffs the approaching storm&mdash;He spoke in<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_178" id="vol_i_Page_178">[Pg&nbsp;178]</a></span> monosyllables when he
spoke at all; and&mdash;what perhaps illustrated in the strongest manner the
depth of his feelings&mdash;he refused, in face of the whole company, to
pledge Sir Bingo in a glass of the Baronet's peculiar cogniac.</p>

<p>At length, the whole Well was alarmed by the report brought by a smart
outrider, that the young Earl of Etherington, reported to be rising on
the horizon of fashion as a star of the first magnitude, intended to
pass an hour, or a day, or a week, as it might happen, (for his lordship
could not be supposed to know his own mind,) at St. Ronan's Well.</p>

<p>This suddenly put all in motion. Almanacks were opened to ascertain his
lordship's age, enquiries were made concerning the extent of his
fortune, his habits were quoted, his tastes were guessed at; and all
that the ingenuity of the Managing Committee could devise was resorted
to, in order to recommend their Spa to this favourite of fortune. An
express was dispatched to Shaws-Castle with the agreeable intelligence,
which fired the train of hope that led to Mowbray's appropriation of his
sister's capital. He did not, however, think proper to obey the summons
to the Spring; for, not being aware in what light the Earl might regard
the worthies there assembled, he did not desire to be found by his
lordship in any strict connexion with them.</p>

<p>Sir Bingo Binks was in a different situation. The bravery with which he
had endured the censure of the place began to give way, when he
considered that a person of such distinction as that which public
opinion attached to Lord Etherington, should find him bodily indeed at
St. Ronan's, but, so far as society was concerned, on the road towards
the ancient cit<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_179" id="vol_i_Page_179">[Pg&nbsp;179]</a></span>y of Coventry; and his banishment thither, incurred by
that most unpardonable offence in modern morality, a solecism in the
code of honour. Though sluggish and inert when called to action, the
Baronet was by no means an absolute coward; or, if so, he was of that
class which fights when reduced to extremity. He manfully sent for
Captain MacTurk, who waited upon him with a grave solemnity of aspect,
which instantly was exchanged for a radiant joy, when Sir Bingo, in a
few words, empowered him to carry a message to that d&mdash;&mdash;d strolling
artist, by whom he had been insulted three days since.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By Cot,&rdquo; said the Captain, &ldquo;my exceedingly goot and excellent friend,
and I am happy to do such a favour for you! And it's well you have
thought of it yourself; because, if it had not been for some of our very
goot and excellent friends, that would be putting their spoon into other
folk's dish, I should have been asking you a civil question myself, how
you came to dine with us, with all that mud and mire which Mr. Tyrrel's
grasp has left upon the collar of your coat&mdash;you understand me.&mdash;But it
is much better as it is, and I will go to the man with all the speed of
light; and though, to be sure, it should have been sooner thought of,
yet let me alone to make an excuse for that, just in my own civil
way&mdash;better late thrive than never do well, you know, Sir Bingo; and if
you have made him wait a little while for his morning, you must give him
the better measure, my darling.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So saying, he awaited no reply, lest peradventure the commission with
which he was so hastily and unexpectedly charged, should have been
clogged with some condition of compromise. No such proposal, ho<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_180" id="vol_i_Page_180">[Pg&nbsp;180]</a></span>wever,
was made on the part of the doughty Sir Bingo, who eyed his friend as he
hastily snatched up his rattan to depart, with a dogged look of
obstinacy, expressive, to use his own phrase, of a determined resolution
to come up to the scratch; and when he heard the Captain's parting
footsteps, and saw the door shut behind him, he valiantly whistled a few
bars of Jenny Sutton, in token he cared not a farthing how the matter
was to end.</p>

<p>With a swifter pace than his half-pay leisure usually encouraged, or
than his habitual dignity permitted, Captain MacTurk cleared the ground
betwixt the Spring and its gay vicinity, and the ruins of the Aultoun,
where reigned our friend Meg Dods, the sole assertor of its ancient
dignities. To the door of the Cleikum Inn the Captain addressed himself,
as one too much accustomed to war to fear a rough reception; although at
the very first aspect of Meg, who presented her person at the half
opened door, his military experience taught him that his entrance into
the place would, in all probability, be disputed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is Mr. Tyrrel at home?&rdquo; was the question; and the answer was conveyed,
by the counter-interrogation, &ldquo;Wha may ye be that speers?&rdquo;</p>

<p>As the most polite reply to this question, and an indulgence, at the
same time, of his own taciturn disposition, the Captain presented to
Luckie Dods the fifth part of an ordinary playing card, much grimed with
snuff, which bore on its blank side his name and quality. But Luckie
Dods rejected the information thus tendered, with contemptuous scorn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nane of your deil's play-books for me,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;it's an ill world
since sic pr<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_181" id="vol_i_Page_181">[Pg&nbsp;181]</a></span>ick-my-dainty doings came in fashion&mdash;It's a poor tongue
that canna tell its ain name, and I'll hae nane of your scarts upon
pasteboard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am Captain MacTurk, of the &mdash;&mdash; regiment,&rdquo; said the Captain,
disdaining further answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;MacTurk?&rdquo; repeated Meg, with an emphasis, which induced the owner of
the name to reply, &ldquo;Yes, honest woman&mdash;MacTurk&mdash;Hector MacTurk&mdash;have you
any objections to my name, goodwife?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nae objections have I,&rdquo; answered Meg; &ldquo;it's e'en an excellent name for
a heathen.&mdash;But, Captain MacTurk, since sae it be that ye are a captain,
ye may e'en face about and march your ways hame again, to the tune of
Dumbarton drums; for ye are ganging to have nae speech of Maister Tirl,
or ony lodger of mine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And wherefore not?&rdquo; demanded the veteran; &ldquo;and is this of your own
foolish head, honest woman, or has your lodger left such orders?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe he has and maybe no,&rdquo; answered Meg, sturdily; &ldquo;and I ken nae mair
right that ye suld ca' me honest woman, than I have to ca' you honest
man, whilk is as far frae my thoughts as it wad be from heaven's truth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The woman is deleerit!&rdquo; said Captain MacTurk; &ldquo;but coom, coom&mdash;a
gentleman is not to be misused in this way when he comes on a
gentleman's business; so make you a bit room on the door-stane, that I
may pass by you, or I will make room for myself, by Cot! to your small
pleasure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And so saying he assumed the air of a man who was about to make good his
passage. But Meg, without deigning farther reply, flourished around her
head the hearth-broom, which she had been employing to its more
legitimate purpose, when disturbed in her housewifery by Captain
MacTurk.<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_182" id="vol_i_Page_182">[Pg&nbsp;182]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I ken your errand weel eneugh, Captain&mdash;and I ken yoursell. Ye are ane
of the folk that gang about yonder setting folk by the lugs, as callants
set their collies to fight. But ye sall come to nae lodger o' mine, let
a-be Maister Tirl, wi' ony sic ungodly errand; for I am ane that will
keep God's peace and the King's within my dwelling.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So saying, and in explicit token of her peaceable intentions, she again
flourished her broom.</p>

<p>The veteran instinctively threw himself under Saint George's guard, and
drew two paces back, exclaiming, &ldquo;That the woman was either mad, or as
drunk as whisky could make her;&rdquo; an alternative which afforded Meg so
little satisfaction, that she fairly rushed on her retiring adversary,
and began to use her weapon to fell purpose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Me drunk, ye scandalous blackguard!&rdquo; (a blow with the broom interposed
as parenthesis,) &ldquo;me, that am fasting from all but sin and bohea!&rdquo;
(another whack.)</p>

<p>The Captain, swearing, exclaiming, and parrying, caught the blows as
they fell, showing much dexterity in single-stick. The people began to
gather; and how long his gallantry might have maintained itself against
the spirit of self-defence and revenge, must be left uncertain, for the
arrival of Tyrrel, returned from a short walk, put a period to the
contest.</p>

<p>Meg, who had a great respect for her guest, began to feel ashamed of her
own violence, and slunk into the house; observing, however, that she
trewed she had made her hearth-broom and the auld heathen's pow right
weel acquainted. The tran<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_183" id="vol_i_Page_183">[Pg&nbsp;183]</a></span>quillity which ensued upon her departure, gave
Tyrrel an opportunity to ask the Captain, whom he at length recognised,
the meaning of this singular affray, and whether the visit was intended
for him; to which the veteran replied very discomposedly, that &ldquo;he
should have known that long enough ago, if he had had decent people to
open his door, and answer a civil question, instead of a flyting
madwoman, who was worse than an eagle,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;or a mastiff-bitch, or
a she-bear, or any other female beast in the creation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Half suspecting his errand, and desirous to avoid unnecessary notoriety,
Tyrrel, as he showed the Captain to the parlour, which he called his
own, entreated him to excuse the rudeness of his landlady, and to pass
from the topic to that which had procured him the honour of this visit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you are right, my good Master Tyrrel,&rdquo; said the Captain, pulling
down the sleeves of his coat, adjusting his handkerchief and
breast-ruffle, and endeavouring to recover the composure of manner
becoming his mission, but still adverting indignantly to the usage he
had received&mdash;&ldquo;By Cot! if she had but been a man, if it were the King
himself&mdash;However, Mr. Tyrrel, I am come on a civil errand&mdash;and very
civilly I have been treated&mdash;the auld bitch should be set in the stocks,
and be tamned!&mdash;My friend, Sir Bingo&mdash;By Cot! I shall never forget that
woman's insolence&mdash;if there be a constable or a cat-o'-nine-tails within
ten miles&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I perceive, Captain,&rdquo; said Tyrrel, &ldquo;that you are too much disturbed at
this moment to enter upon the business which has brought you here&mdash;if
you will step into my bedroom, and make use of some cold water and a
towel, it will give you the time to compose your<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_184" id="vol_i_Page_184">[Pg&nbsp;184]</a></span>self a little.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall do no such thing, Mr. Tyrrel,&rdquo; answered the Captain,
snappishly; &ldquo;I do not want to be composed at all, and I do not want to
stay in this house a minute longer than to do my errand to you on my
friend's behalf&mdash;And as for this tamned woman Dods&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will in that case forgive my interrupting you, Captain MacTurk, as
I presume your errand to me can have no reference to this strange
quarrel with my landlady, with which I have nothing to&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And if I thought that it had, sir,&rdquo; said the Captain, interrupting
Tyrrel in his turn, &ldquo;you should have given me satisfaction before you
was a quarter of an hour older&mdash;Oh, I would give five pounds to the
pretty fellow that would say, Captain MacTurk, the woman did right!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I certainly will not be that person you wish for, Captain,&rdquo; replied
Tyrrel, &ldquo;because I really do not know who was in the right or wrong; but
I am certainly sorry that you should have met with ill usage, when your
purpose was to visit me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, sir, if you are concerned,&rdquo; said the man of peace, snappishly,
&ldquo;so am I, and there is an end of it.&mdash;And touching my errand to you&mdash;you
cannot have forgotten that you treated my friend, Sir Bingo Binks, with
singular incivility?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I recollect nothing of the kind, Captain,&rdquo; replied Tyrrel. &ldquo;I remember
that the gentleman, so called, took some uncivil liberties in laying
foolish bets concerning me, and that I treated him, from respect to the
rest of the company, and the ladies in particular, with a great degree
of moderation and forbearance.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_185" id="vol_i_Page_185">[Pg&nbsp;185]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;And you must have very fine ideas of forbearance,&rdquo; replied the Captain,
&ldquo;when you took my good friend by the collar of the coat, and lifted him
out of your way as if he had been a puppy dog! My good Mr. Tyrrel, I can
assure you he does not think that you have forborne him at all, and he
has no purpose to forbear you; and I must either carry back a sufficient
apology, or you must meet in a quiet way, with a good friend on each
side.&mdash;And this was the errand I came on, when this tamned woman, with
the hearth-broom, who is an enemy to all quiet and peaceable
proceedings&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will forget Mrs. Dods for the present, if you please, Captain
MacTurk,&rdquo; said Tyrrel&mdash;&ldquo;and, to speak to the present subject, you will
permit me to say, that I think this summons comes a little of the
latest. You know best as a military man, but I have always understood
that such differences are usually settled immediately after they
occur&mdash;not that I intend to baulk Sir Bingo's inclinations upon the
score of delay, or any other account.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I dare say you will not&mdash;I dare say you will not, Mr. Tyrrel,&rdquo; answered
the Captain&mdash;&ldquo;I am free to think that you know better what belongs to a
gentleman.&mdash;And as to time&mdash;look you, my good sir, there are different
sorts of people in this world, as there are different sorts of
fire-arms. There are your hair-trigger'd rifles, that go off just at the
right moment, and in the twinkling of an eye, and that, Mr. Tyrrel, is
your true man of honour;&mdash;and there is a sort of person that takes a
thing up too soon, and sometimes backs out of it, like your rubbishy
Birmingham pieces, that will at one time go off at half-cock, and at
another time burn primi<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_186" id="vol_i_Page_186">[Pg&nbsp;186]</a></span>ng without going off at all;&mdash;then again pieces
that hang fire&mdash;or I should rather say, that are like the matchlocks
which the black fellows use in the East Indies&mdash;there must be some
blowing of the match, and so forth, which occasions delay, but the piece
carries true enough after all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And your friend Sir Bingo's valour is of this last kind, Captain&mdash;I
presume that is the inference. I should have thought it more like a
boy's cannon, which is fired by means of a train, and is but a pop-gun
after all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot allow of such comparisons, sir,&rdquo; said the Captain; &ldquo;you will
understand that I come here as Sir Bingo's friend, and a reflection on
him will be an affront to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I disclaim all intended offence to you, Captain&mdash;I have no wish to
extend the number of my adversaries, or to add to them the name of a
gallant officer like yourself,&rdquo; replied Tyrrel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are too obliging, sir,&rdquo; said the Captain, drawing himself up with
dignity. &ldquo;By Cot! and that was said very handsomely!&mdash;Well, sir, and
shall I not have the pleasure of carrying back any explanation from you
to Sir Bingo?&mdash;I assure you it would give me pleasure to make this
matter handsomely up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To Sir Bingo, Captain MacTurk, I have no apology to offer&mdash;I think I
treated him more gently than his impertinence deserved.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Och, Och!&rdquo; sighed the Captain, with a strong Highland intonation; &ldquo;then
there is no more to be said, but just to settle time and place; for
pistols I suppose must be the weapons.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All these matters are quite the same to me,&rdquo; said Tyrrel; &ldquo;onl<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_187" id="vol_i_Page_187">[Pg&nbsp;187]</a></span>y, in
respect of time, I should wish it to be as speedy as possible.&mdash;What say
you to one, afternoon, this very day?&mdash;You may name the place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At one, afternoon,&rdquo; replied the Captain deliberately, &ldquo;Sir Bingo will
attend you&mdash;the place may be the Buck-stane; for as the whole company go
to the water-side to-day to eat a kettle of fish,<a name="vol_i_FNanchor_18_18" id="vol_i_FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#vol_i_Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> there will be no
risk of interruption.&mdash;And who shall I speak to, my good friend, on your
side of the quarrel?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really, Captain,&rdquo; replied Tyrrel, &ldquo;that is a puzzling question&mdash;I have
no friend here&mdash;I suppose you could hardly act for both?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would be totally, absolutely, and altogether out of the question, my
good friend,&rdquo; replied MacTurk. &ldquo;But if you will trust to me, I will
bring up a friend on your part from the Well, who, though you have
hardly seen him before, will settle matters for you as well as if you
had been intimate for twenty years&mdash;and I will bring up the Doctor too,
if I can get him unloosed from the petticoat of that fat widow Blower,
that he has strung himself upon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have no doubt y<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_188" id="vol_i_Page_188">[Pg&nbsp;188]</a></span>ou will do every thing with perfect accuracy, Captain.
At one o'clock, then, we meet at the Buck-stane&mdash;Stay, permit me to see
you to the door.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By Cot! and it is not altogether so unnecessary,&rdquo; said the Captain;
&ldquo;for the tamned woman with the besom might have some advantage in that
long dark passage, knowing the ground better than I do&mdash;tamn her, I will
have amends on her, if there be whipping-post, or ducking-stool, or a
pair of stocks in the parish!&rdquo; And so saying, the Captain trudged off,
his spirits ever and anon agitated by recollection of the causeless
aggression of Meg Dods, and again composed to a state of happy serenity
by the recollection of the agreeable arrangement which he had made
between Mr. Tyrrel, and his friend Sir Bingo Binks.</p>

<p>We have heard of men of undoubted benevolence of character and
disposition, whose principal delight was to see a miserable criminal,
degraded alike by his previous crimes, and the sentence which he had
incurred, conclude a vicious and wretched life, by an ignominious and
painful death. It was some such inconsistency of character which induced
honest Captain MacTurk, who had really been a meritorious officer, and
was a good-natured, honourable, and well-intentioned man, to place his
chief delight in setting his friends by the ears, and then acting as
umpire in the dangerous rencontres, which, according to his code of
honour, were absolutely necessary to restore peace and cordiality.<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_189" id="vol_i_Page_189">[Pg&nbsp;189]</a></span> We
leave the explanation of such anomalies to the labours of craniologists,
for they seem to defy all the researches of the Ethic philosopher.</p>

<h3>DISAPPOINTMENT.</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Evans.</i> I pray you now, good Master Slender's serving-man, and
friend Simple by your name, which way have you looked for Master
Caius?</p>

<p><i>Slender.</i> Marry, sir, the City-ward, the Park-ward, every way; Old
Windsor way, and every way.</p></div>

<p class="citation">
<i>Merry Wives of Windsor.</i><br />
</p>


<p>Sir Bingo Binks received the Captain's communication with the same
dogged sullenness he had displayed at sending the challenge; a most
ungracious <i>humph</i>, ascending, as it were, from the very bottom of his
stomach, through the folds of a Belcher handkerchief, intimating his
acquiescence, in a tone nearly as gracious as that with which the drowsy
traveller acknowledges the intimation of the slipshod ostler, that it is
on the stroke of five, and the horn will sound in a minute. Captain
MacTurk by no means considered this ejaculation as expressing a proper
estimate of his own trouble and services. &ldquo;Humph?&rdquo; he replied; &ldquo;and what
does that mean, Sir Bingo? Have not I here had the trouble to put you
just into the neat road; and would you have been able to make a handsome
affair out of it at all, after you had let it hang so long in the wind,
if I had not <span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_190" id="vol_i_Page_190">[Pg&nbsp;190]</a></span>taken on myself to make it agreeable to the gentleman, and
cooked as neat a mess out of it as I have seen a Frenchman do out of a
stale sprat?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sir Bingo saw it was necessary to mutter some intimation of acquiescence
and acknowledgment, which, however inarticulate, was sufficient to
satisfy the veteran, to whom the adjustment of a personal affair of this
kind was a labour of love, and who now, kindly mindful of his promise to
Tyrrel, hurried away as if he had been about the most charitable action
upon earth, to secure the attendance of some one as a witness on the
stranger's part.</p>

<p>Mr. Winterblossom was the person whom MacTurk had in his own mind
pitched upon as the fittest person to perform this act of benevolence,
and he lost no time in communicating his wish to that worthy gentleman.
But Mr. Winterblossom, though a man of the world, and well enough
acquainted with such matters, was by no means so passionately addicted
to them as was the man of peace, Captain Hector MacTurk. As a <i>bon
vivant</i>, he hated trouble of any kind, and the shrewd selfishness of his
disposition enabled him to foresee, that a good deal might accrue to all
concerned in the course of this business. He, therefore, coolly replied,
that he knew nothing of Mr. Tyrrel&mdash;not even whether he was a gentleman
or not; and besides, he had received no regular application in his
behalf&mdash;he did not, therefore, feel himself at all inclined to go to the
field as his second. This refusal drove the poor Captain to despair. He
conjured his friend to be more public-spirited, and entreated him to
consider the reputation of the Well, which was to them as a common
country, and the honour of <span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_191" id="vol_i_Page_191">[Pg&nbsp;191]</a></span>the company to which they both belonged, and
of which Mr. Winterblossom was in a manner the proper representative, as
being, with consent of all, the perpetual president. He reminded him
how many quarrels had been nightly undertaken and departed from on the
ensuing morning, without any suitable consequences&mdash;said, &ldquo;that people
began to talk of the place oddly; and that, for his own part, he found
his own honour so nearly touched, that he had begun to think he himself
would be obliged to bring somebody or other to account, for the general
credit of the Well; and now, just when the most beautiful occasion had
arisen to put every thing on a handsome footing, it was hard&mdash;it was
cruel&mdash;it was most unjustifiable&mdash;in Mr. Winterblossom, to decline so
simple a matter as was requested of him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dry and taciturn as the Captain was on all ordinary occasions, he
proved, on the present, eloquent and almost pathetic; for the tears came
into his eyes when he recounted the various quarrels which had become
addled, notwithstanding his best endeavours to hatch them into an
honourable meeting; and here was one, at length, just chipping the
shell, like to be smothered, for want of the most ordinary concession on
the part of Winterblossom. In short, that gentleman could not hold out
any longer. &ldquo;It was,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;a very foolish business, he thought; but
to oblige Sir Bingo and Captain MacTurk, he had no objection to walk
with them about noon as far as the Buck-stane, although he must observe
the day was hazy, and he had felt a prophetic twinge or two, which
looked like a visit of his old acquaintance podagra.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind that, my excellent friend,&rdquo; said the Capt<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_192" id="vol_i_Page_192">[Pg&nbsp;192]</a></span>ain, &ldquo;a sup out of
Sir Bingo's flask is like enough to put that to rights; and by my soul,
it is not the thing he is like to leave behind him on this sort of
occasion, unless I be far mistaken in my man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Winterblossom, &ldquo;although I comply with your wishes thus far,
Captain MacTurk, I by no means undertake for certain to back this same
Master Tyrrel, of whom I know nothing at all, but only agree to go to
the place in hopes of preventing mischief.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never fash your beard about that, Mr. Winterblossom,&rdquo; replied the
Captain; &ldquo;for a little mischief, as you call it, is become a thing
absolutely necessary to the credit of the place; and I am sure, whatever
be the consequences, they cannot in the present instance be very fatal
to any body; for here is a young fellow that, if he should have a
misfortune, nobody will miss, for nobody knows him; then there is Sir
Bingo, whom every body knows so well, that they will miss him all the
less.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And there will be Lady Bingo, a wealthy and handsome young widow,&rdquo; said
Winterblossom, throwing his hat upon his head with the grace and
pretension of former days, and sighing to see, as he looked in the
mirror, how much time, that had whitened his hair, rounded his stomach,
wrinkled his brow, and bent down his shoulders, had disqualified him, as
he expressed it, &ldquo;for entering for such a plate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Secure of Winterblossom, the Captain's next anxiety was to obtain the
presence of Dr. Quackleben, who, although he wrote himself M.D., did not
by any means decline practice as a surgeon, when any job offered for
which he was likely to be well pa<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_193" id="vol_i_Page_193">[Pg&nbsp;193]</a></span>id, as was warranted in the present
instance, the wealthy baronet being a party principally concerned. The
Doctor, therefore, like the eagle scenting the carnage, seized, at the
first word, the huge volume of morocco leather which formed his case of
portable instruments, and uncoiled before the Captain, with ostentatious
display, its formidable and glittering contents, upon which he began to
lecture as upon a copious and interesting text, until the man of war
thought it necessary to give him a word of caution.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Och,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;I do pray you, Doctor, to carry that packet of yours
under the breast of your coat, or in your pocket, or somewhere out of
sight, and by no means to produce or open it before the parties. For
although scalpels, and tourniquets, and pincers, and the like, are very
ingenious implements, and pretty to behold, and are also useful when
time and occasion call for them, yet I have known the sight of them take
away a man's fighting stomach, and so lose their owner a job, Dr.
Quackleben.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By my faith, Captain MacTurk,&rdquo; said the Doctor, &ldquo;you speak as if you
were graduated!&mdash;I have known these treacherous articles play their
master many a cursed trick. The very sight of my forceps, without the
least effort on my part, once cured an inveterate toothache of three
days' duration, prevented the extraction of a carious molendinar, which
it was the very end of their formation to achieve, and sent me home
minus a guinea.&mdash;But hand me that great-coat, Captain, and we will place
the instruments in ambuscade, until they are called into action in due
time. I should think something will happen&mdash;Sir Bingo is a sure shot at
a moorcock.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_194" id="vol_i_Page_194">[Pg&nbsp;194]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Cannot say,&rdquo; replied MacTurk; &ldquo;I have known the pistol shake many a
hand that held the fowlingpiece fast enough. Yonder Tyrrel looks like a
teevilish cool customer&mdash;I watched him the whole time I was delivering
my errand, and I can promise you he is mettle to the backbone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;I will have my bandages ready <i>secundum artem</i>,&rdquo; replied the man
of medicine. &ldquo;We must guard against h&aelig;morrhage&mdash;Sir Bingo is a plethoric
subject.&mdash;One o'clock, you say&mdash;at the Buck-stane&mdash;I will be punctual.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you not walk with us?&rdquo; said Captain MacTurk, who seemed willing to
keep his whole convoy together on this occasion, lest, peradventure, any
of them had fled from under his patronage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied the Doctor, &ldquo;I must first make an apology to worthy Mrs.
Blower, for I had promised her my arm down to the river-side, where they
are all to eat a kettle of fish.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By Cot! and I hope we shall make them a prettier kettle of fish than
was ever seen at St. Ronan's,&rdquo; said the Captain, rubbing his hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don't say <i>we</i>, Captain,&rdquo; replied the cautious Doctor; &ldquo;I for one have
nothing to do with the meeting&mdash;wash my hands of it. No, no, I cannot
afford to be clapt up as accessory.&mdash;You ask me to meet you at the
Buck-stane&mdash;no purpose assigned&mdash;I am willing to oblige my worthy
friend, Captain MacTurk&mdash;walk that way, thinking of nothing
particular&mdash;hear the report of pistols&mdash;hasten to the spot&mdash;fortunately
just in time to prevent the most fatal consequences&mdash;chance most
opportunely to have my case of instruments with me&mdash;indeed, generally
walk with them <span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_195" id="vol_i_Page_195">[Pg&nbsp;195]</a></span>about me&mdash;<i>nunquam non paratus</i>&mdash;then give my
professional definition of the wound and state of the patient. That is
the way to give evidence, Captain, before sheriffs, coroners, and such
sort of folk&mdash;never commit one's self&mdash;it is a rule of our profession.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, well, Doctor,&rdquo; answered the Captain, &ldquo;you know your own ways
best; and so you are but there to give a chance of help in case of
accident, all the laws of honour will be fully complied with. But it
would be a foul reflection upon me, as a man of honour, if I did not
take care that there should be somebody to come in thirdsman between
Death and my principal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At the awful hour of one afternoon, there arrived upon the appointed
spot Captain MacTurk, leading to the field the valorous Sir Bingo, not
exactly straining like a greyhound in the slips, but rather looking
moody like a butcher's bull-dog, which knows he must fight since his
master bids him. Yet the Baronet showed no outward flinching or
abatement of courage, excepting, that the tune of Jenny Sutton, which he
had whistled without intermission since he left the Hotel, had, during
the last half mile of their walk, sunk into silence; although, to look
at the muscles of the mouth, projection of the lip, and vacancy of the
eye, it seemed as if the notes were still passing through his mind, and
that he whistled Jenny Sutton in his imagination. Mr. Winterblossom came
two minutes after this happy pair, and the Doctor was equally punctual.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Upon my soul,&rdquo; said the former, &ldquo;this is a mighty silly affair, Sir
Bingo, and might, I think, be easily taken up, at less risk to all
parties<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_196" id="vol_i_Page_196">[Pg&nbsp;196]</a></span> than a meeting of this kind. You should recollect, Sir Bingo,
that you have much depending upon your life&mdash;you are a married man, Sir
Bingo.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sir Bingo turned the quid in his mouth, and squirted out the juice in a
most coachman-like manner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Winterblossom,&rdquo; said the Captain, &ldquo;Sir Bingo has in this matter put
himself in my hands, and unless you think yourself more able to direct
his course than I am, I must frankly tell you, that I will be disobliged
by your interference. You may speak to your own friend as much as you
please; and if you find yourself authorized to make any proposal, I
shall be desirous to lend an ear to it on the part of my worthy
principal, Sir Bingo. But I will be plain with you, that I do not
greatly approve of settlements upon the field, though I hope I am a
quiet and peaceable man. But here is our honour to be looked after in
the first place; and moreover, I must insist that every proposal for
accommodation shall originate with your party or yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>My</i> party?&rdquo; answered Winterblossom; &ldquo;why really, though I came hither
at your request, Captain MacTurk, yet I must see more of the matter, ere
I can fairly pronounce myself second to a man I never saw but once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And, perhaps, may never see again,&rdquo; said the Doctor, looking at his
watch; &ldquo;for it is ten minutes past the hour, and here is no Mr. Tyrrel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hey! what's that you say, Doctor?&rdquo; said the Baronet, awakened from his
apathy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He speaks tamned nonsense,&rdquo; said the Captain, pulling out a huge,
old-fashioned, turnip-shaped implement, with a blackened silver
dial-plate. &ldquo;It is not abo<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_197" id="vol_i_Page_197">[Pg&nbsp;197]</a></span>ve three minutes after one by the true time,
and I will uphold Mr. Tyrrel to be a man of his word&mdash;never saw a man
take a thing more coolly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not more coolly than he takes his walk this way,&rdquo; said the Doctor; &ldquo;for
the hour is as I tell you&mdash;remember, I am professional&mdash;have pulses to
count by the second and half-second&mdash;my timepiece must go as true as the
sun.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I have mounted guard a thousand times by my watch,&rdquo; said the
Captain; &ldquo;and I defy the devil to say that Hector MacTurk did not always
discharge his duty to the twentieth part of the fraction of a second&mdash;it
was my great grandmother, Lady Killbracklin's, and I will maintain its
reputation against any timepiece that ever went upon wheels.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, then, look at your own watch, Captain,&rdquo; said Winterblossom, &ldquo;for
time stands still with no man, and while we speak the hour advances. On
my word, I think this Mr. Tyrrel intends to humbug us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hey! what's that you say?&rdquo; said Sir Bingo, once more starting from his
sullen reverie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall not look at my watch upon no such matter,&rdquo; said the Captain;
&ldquo;nor will I any way be disposed to doubt your friend's honour, Mr.
Winterblossom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>My</i> friend?&rdquo; said Mr. Winterblossom; &ldquo;I must tell you once more,
Captain, that this Mr. Tyrrel is no friend of mine&mdash;none in the world.
He is your friend, Captain MacTurk; and I own, if he keeps us waiting
much longer on this occasion, I will be apt to consider his friendship
as of very little value.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And how dare you, then, say that the man is my friend?&rdquo; said the
Captain, knitting his brows in a most form<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_198" id="vol_i_Page_198">[Pg&nbsp;198]</a></span>idable manner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pooh! pooh! Captain,&rdquo; answered Winterblossom, coolly, if not
contemptuously&mdash;&ldquo;keep all that for silly boys; I have lived in the world
too long either to provoke quarrels, or to care about them. So, reserve
your fire; it is all thrown away on such an old cock as I am. But I
really wish we knew whether this fellow means to come&mdash;twenty minutes
past the hour&mdash;I think it is odds that you are bilked, Sir Bingo?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bilked! hey!&rdquo; cried Sir Bingo; &ldquo;by Gad, I always thought so&mdash;I wagered
with Mowbray he was a raff&mdash;I am had, by Gad. I'll wait no longer than
the half hour, by Gad, were he a field-marshal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will be directed in that matter by your friend, if you please, Sir
Bingo,&rdquo; said the Captain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;D&mdash;&mdash; me if I will,&rdquo; returned the Baronet&mdash;&ldquo;Friend? a pretty friend, to
bring me out here on such a fool's errand! I knew the fellow was a
raff&mdash;but I never thought you, with all your chaff about honour, such a
d&mdash;&mdash;d spoon as to bring a message from a fellow who has fled the pit!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you regret so much having come here to no purpose,&rdquo; said the
Captain, in a very lofty tone, &ldquo;and if you think I have used you like a
spoon, as you say, I will have no objection in life to take Mr. Tyrrel's
place, and serve your occasion, my boy!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By &mdash;&mdash;! and if you like it, you may fire away, and welcome,&rdquo; said Sir
Bingo; &ldquo;and I'll spin a crown for first shot, for I do not understand
being brought here for nothing, d&mdash;&mdash; me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And there was never man alive so ready as I am to give you something to
stay your stomach,&rdquo; said the irritable Highlander.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 800px;">
<img src="images/illus-1.198.jpg" width="800" height="504" alt="" title="" />
</div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_199" id="vol_i_Page_199">[Pg&nbsp;199]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh fie, gentlemen! fie, fie, fie!&rdquo; exclaimed the pacific Mr.
Winterblossom&mdash;&ldquo;For shame, Captain&mdash;Out upon you, Sir Bingo, are you
mad?&mdash;what, principal and second!&mdash;the like was never heard of&mdash;never.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The parties were in some degree recalled to their more cool
recollections by this expostulation, yet continued a short quarter-deck
walk to and fro, upon parallel lines, looking at each other sullenly as
they passed, and bristling like two dogs who have a mind to quarrel, yet
hesitate to commence hostilities. During this promenade, also, the
perpendicular and erect carriage of the veteran, rising on his toes at
every step, formed a whimsical contrast with the heavy loutish shuffle
of the bulky Baronet, who had, by dint of practice, very nearly attained
that most enviable of all carriages, the gait of a shambling Yorkshire
ostler. His coarse spirit was now thoroughly kindled, and like iron, or
any other baser metal, which is slow in receiving heat, it retained long
the smouldering and angry spirit of resentment that had originally
brought him to the place, and now rendered him willing to wreak his
uncomfortable feelings upon the nearest object which occurred, since the
first purpose of his coming thither was frustrated. In his own phrase,
his pluck was up, and finding himself in a fighting humour, he thought
it a pity, like Bob Acres, that so much good courage should be thrown
away. As, however, that courage after all consisted chiefly in ill
humour; and as, in the demeanour of the Captain, he read nothing
deferential or deprecatory of his wrath, he began to listen with more
attention to the arguments of Mr. Wint<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_200" id="vol_i_Page_200">[Pg&nbsp;200]</a></span>erblossom, who entreated them not
to sully, by private quarrel, the honour they had that day so happily
acquired without either blood or risk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was now,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;three quarters of an hour past the time
appointed for this person, who calls himself Tyrrel, to meet Sir Bingo
Binks. Now, instead of standing squabbling here, which serves no
purpose, I propose we should reduce to writing the circumstances which
attend this affair, for the satisfaction of the company at the Well, and
that the memorandum shall be regularly attested by our subscriptions;
after which, I shall farther humbly propose that it be subjected to the
revision of the Committee of Management.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I object to any revision of a statement to which my name shall be
appended,&rdquo; said the Captain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Right&mdash;very true, Captain,&rdquo; said the complaisant Mr. Winterblossom;
&ldquo;undoubtedly you know best, and your signature is completely sufficient
to authenticate this transaction&mdash;however, as it is the most important
which has occurred since the Spring was established, I propose we shall
all sign the <i>proc&egrave;s-verbal</i>, as I may term it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Leave me out, if you please,&rdquo; said the Doctor, not much satisfied that
both the original quarrel and the by-battle had passed over without any
occasion for the offices of a Machaon; &ldquo;leave me out, if you please; for
it does not become me to be ostensibly concerned in any proceedings,
which have had for their object a breach of the peace. And for the
importance of waiting here for an hour, in a fine afternoon, it is my
opinion there was a more important service done to the Well of St.
Ronan's, when I, Quentin Quackleben, M.D., cured Lady Penelope
Penfeather of her seventh attack upon the nerves, attended with febrile
symptoms.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_201" id="vol_i_Page_201">[Pg&nbsp;201]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;No disparagement to your skill at all, Doctor,&rdquo; said Mr. Winterblossom;
&ldquo;but I conceive the lesson which this fellow has received will be a
great means to prevent improper persons from appearing at the Spring
hereafter; and, for my part, I shall move that no one be invited to dine
at the table in future, till his name is regularly entered as a member
of the company, in the lists at the public room. And I hope both Sir
Bingo and the Captain will receive the thanks of the company, for their
spirited conduct in expelling the intruder.&mdash;Sir Bingo, will you allow
me to apply to your flask&mdash;a little twinge I feel, owing to the dampness
of the grass.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sir Bingo, soothed by the consequence he had acquired, readily imparted
to the invalid a thimbleful of his cordial, which, we believe, had been
prepared by some cunning chemist in the wilds of Glenlivat. He then
filled a bumper, and extended it towards the veteran, as an unequivocal
symptom of reconciliation. The real turbinacious flavour no sooner
reached the nose of the Captain, than the beverage was turned down his
throat with symptoms of most unequivocal applause.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall have some hope of the young fellows of this day,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;now
that they begin to give up their Dutch and French distilled waters, and
stick to genuine Highland ware. By Cot, it is the only liquor fit for a
gentleman to drink in a morning, if he can have the good fortune to come
by it, you see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Or after dinner either, Captain,&rdquo; said the Doctor, to whom the glass
had passed in rotation; &ldquo;it is worth all the wines in France for
flavour, and more cordial to the system besides.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_202" id="vol_i_Page_202">[Pg&nbsp;202]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; said the Captain, &ldquo;that we may not go off the ground with any
thing on our stomachs worse than the whisky, I can afford to say, (as
Captain Hector MacTurk's character is tolerably well established,) that
I am sorry for the little difference that has occurred betwixt me and my
worthy friend, Sir Bingo, here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And since you are so civil, Captain,&rdquo; said Sir Bingo, &ldquo;why, I am sorry
too&mdash;only it would put the devil out of temper to lose so fine a fishing
day&mdash;wind south&mdash;fine air on the pool&mdash;water settled from the
flood&mdash;just in trim&mdash;and I dare say three pairs of hooks have passed
over my cast before this time!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He closed this elaborate lamentation with a libation of the same cordial
which he had imparted to his companions; and they returned in a body to
the Hotel, where the transactions of the morning were soon afterwards
announced to the company, by the following program:&mdash;</p>


<h4>STATEMENT.</h4>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;Sir Bingo Binks, baronet, having found himself aggrieved by the
uncivil behaviour of an individual calling himself Francis Tyrrel,
now or lately a resident at the Cleikum Inn, Aultoun of St.
Ronan's; and having empowered Captain Hector MacTurk to wait upon
the said Mr. Tyrrel to demand an apology, under the alternative of
personal satisfaction, according to the laws of honour and the
practice of gentlemen, the said Tyrrel voluntarily engaged to meet
the said Sir Bingo Binks, baronet, at the Buck-stane, near St.
Ronan's Burn, upon this present day, being Wednesday &mdash;&mdash; August.
In consequence of which appointment, we, the undersigned, did

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;I, Quentin Quackleben, M.D., F.R.S., D.E., B.L., X.Z., &amp;c. &amp;c.,
being called upon to attest what I know in the said matter, do
hereby verify, that being by accident at the Buck-stane, near St.
Ronan's Burn, on this present day, at the hour of one afternoon,
and chancing to remain there for the space of nearly an hour,
conversing with Sir Bingo Binks, Captain MacTurk, and Mr.
Winterblossom, we did not, during that time, see or hear any thing
of or from the person calling himself Francis Tyrrel, whose
presence at that place seemed to be expected by the gentlemen I
have just named.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>This affiche was dated like the former, and certified under the august
hand of Quentin Quackleben, M.D., &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p>Again, and prefaced by the averment that an improper person had been
lately introduced into the company of St. Ronan's Well, there came forth
a legislative enactment, on the part of the Committee, declaring, &ldquo;that
no one shall in future be invited to the dinners, or balls, or other
entertainments<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_204" id="vol_i_Page_204">[Pg&nbsp;204]</a></span> of the Well, until their names shall be regularly entered
in the books kept for the purpose at the rooms.&rdquo; Lastly, there was a
vote of thanks to Sir Bingo Binks and Captain MacTurk for their
spirited conduct, and the pains which they had taken to exclude an
improper person from the company at St. Ronan's Well.</p>

<p>These annunciations speedily became the magnet of the day. All idlers
crowded to peruse them; and it would be endless to notice the &ldquo;God bless
me's&rdquo;&mdash;the &ldquo;Lord have a care of us&rdquo;&mdash;the &ldquo;Saw you ever the like's&rdquo; of
gossips, any more than the &ldquo;Dear me's&rdquo; and &ldquo;Oh, laa's&rdquo; of the titupping
misses, and the oaths of the pantalooned or buck-skin'd beaux. The
character of Sir Bingo rose like the stocks at the news of a dispatch
from the Duke of Wellington, and, what was extraordinary, attained some
consequence even in the estimation of his lady. All shook their heads at
the recollection of the unlucky Tyrrel, and found out much in his manner
and address which convinced them that he was but an adventurer and
swindler. A few, however, less partial to the Committee of Management,
(for whenever there is an administration, there will soon arise an
opposition,) whispered among themselves, that, to give the fellow his
due, the man, be he what he would, had only come among them, like the
devil, when he was called for; and honest Dame Blower blessed herself
when she heard o<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_205" id="vol_i_Page_205">[Pg&nbsp;205]</a></span>f such bloodthirsty doings as had been intended, and
&ldquo;thanked God that honest Doctor Kickherben had come to nae harm amang a'
their nonsense.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>THE CONSULTATION.</h3>

<i>Measure for Measure.</i><br />
</p>


<p>The borough of &mdash;&mdash; lies, as all the world knows, about fourteen miles
distant from St. Ronan's, being the county town of that shire, which, as
described in the Tourist's Guide, numbers among its objects of interest
that gay and popular watering-place, whose fame, no doubt, will be
greatly enhanced by the present annals of its earlier history. As it is
at present unnecessary to be more particular concerning the scene of our
story, we will fill up the blank left in the first name with the
fictitious appellation of Marchthorn, having often found ourselves
embarrassed in the course of a story, by the occurrence of an ugly
hiatus, which we cannot always at first sight fill up, with the proper
reference to the rest of the narrative.</p>

<p>Marchthorn, then, was an old-fashioned Scottish town, the street of
which, on market-day, showed a reasonable number of stout great-coated
yeomen, bartering or dealing for the various commodities of their farms;
and on other days of the week, only a few forlor<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_206" id="vol_i_Page_206">[Pg&nbsp;206]</a></span>n burghers, crawling
about like half-awakened flies, and watching the town steeple till the
happy sound of twelve strokes from Time's oracle should tell them it
was time to take their meridian dram. The narrow windows of the shops
intimated very imperfectly the miscellaneous contents of the interior,
where every merchant, as the shopkeepers of Marchthorn were termed,
<i>more Scotico</i>, sold every thing that could be thought of. As for
manufactures, there were none, except that of the careful Town-Council,
who were mightily busied in preparing the warp and woof, which, at the
end of every five or six years, the town of Marchthorn contributed, for
the purpose of weaving the fourth or fifth part of a member of
Parliament.</p>

<p>In such a town, it usually happens, that the Sheriff-clerk, especially
supposing him agent for several lairds of the higher order, is possessed
of one of the best-looking houses; and such was that of Mr. Bindloose.
None of the smartness of the brick-built and brass-hammered mansion of a
southern attorney appeared indeed in this mansion, which was a tall,
thin, grim-looking building, in the centre of the town, with narrow
windows and projecting gables, notched into that sort of descent, called
crow-steps, and having the lower casements defended by stancheons of
iron; for Mr. Bindloose, as frequently happens, kept a branch of one of
the two national banks, which had been lately established in the town of
Marchthorn.</p>

<p>Towards the door of this tenement, there advanced slowly up the ancient,
but empty streets of this famous borough, a vehicle, which, had it
appeared in Piccadilly, would have furnished unremitted laughter for a
week, and conversation for a twe<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_207" id="vol_i_Page_207">[Pg&nbsp;207]</a></span>lvemonth. It was a two-wheeled vehicle,
which claimed none of the modern appellations of tilbury, tandem,
dennet, or the like; but aspired only to the humble name of that almost
forgotten accommodation, a whiskey; or, according to some authorities, a
tim-whiskey. Green was, or had been, its original colour, and it was
placed sturdily and safely low upon its little old-fashioned wheels,
which bore much less than the usual proportion to the size of the
carriage which they sustained. It had a calash head, which had been
pulled up, in consideration either to the dampness of the morning air,
or to the retiring delicacy of the fair form which, shrouded by leathern
curtains, tenanted this venerable specimen of antediluvian
coach-building.</p>

<p>But, as this fair and modest dame noway aspired to the skill of a
charioteer, the management of a horse, which seemed as old as the
carriage he drew, was in the exclusive charge of an old fellow in a
postilion's jacket, whose grey hairs escaped on each side of an
old-fashioned velvet jockey-cap, and whose left shoulder was so
considerably elevated above his head, that it seemed, as if, with little
effort, his neck might have been tucked under his arm, like that of a
roasted grouse-cock. This gallant equerry was mounted on a steed as old
as that which toiled betwixt the shafts of the carriage, and which he
guided by a leading rein. Goading one animal with his single spur, and
stimulating the other with his whip, he effected a reasonable trot upon
the causeway, which only terminated when the whiskey stopped at Mr.
Bindloose's door&mdash;an event of importance enough to excite the curiosity
of the inhabitants of that and the neighbouring houses. Wheels wer<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_208" id="vol_i_Page_208">[Pg&nbsp;208]</a></span>e laid
aside, needles left sticking in the half-finished seams, and many a
nose, spectacled and unspectacled, was popped out of the adjoining
windows, which had the good fortune to command a view of Mr. Bindloose's
front door. The faces of two or three giggling clerks were visible at
the barred casements of which we have spoken, much amused at the descent
of an old lady from this respectable carriage, whose dress and
appearance might possibly have been fashionable at the time when her
equipage was new. A satin cardinal, lined with grey squirrels' skin, and
a black silk bonnet, trimmed with crape, were garments which did not now
excite the respect, which in their fresher days they had doubtless
commanded. But there was that in the features of the wearer, which would
have commanded Mr. Bindloose's best regard, though it had appeared in
far worse attire; for he beheld the face of an ancient customer, who had
always paid her law expenses with the ready penny, and whose accompt
with the bank was balanced by a very respectable sum at her credit. It
was, indeed, no other than our respected friend, Mrs. Dods of the
Cleikum Inn, St. Ronan's, Aultoun.</p>

<p>Now her arrival intimated matter of deep import. Meg was a person of all
others most averse to leave her home, where, in her own opinion at
least, nothing went on well without her immediate superintendence.
Limited, therefore, as was her sphere, she remained fixed in the centre
thereof; and few as were her satellites, they were under the necessity
of performing their revolutions around her, while she herself continued
stationary. Saturn, in fact, would be scarce more surprised at a passing
call from the Sun, than Mr. Bindloose at this unexpected <span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_209" id="vol_i_Page_209">[Pg&nbsp;209]</a></span>visit of his
old client. In one breath he rebuked the inquisitive impertinence of his
clerks, in another stimulated his housekeeper, old Hannah&mdash;for Mr.
Bindloose was a bluff bachelor&mdash;to get tea ready in the green parlour;
and while yet speaking, was at the side of the whiskey, unclasping the
curtains, rolling down the apron, and assisting his old friend to
dismount.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The japanned tea-caddie, Hannah&mdash;the best bohea&mdash;bid Tib kindle a spark
of fire&mdash;the morning's damp&mdash;Draw in the giggling faces of ye, ye d&mdash;&mdash;d
idle scoundrels, or laugh at your ain toom pouches&mdash;it will be lang or
your weeldoing fill them.&rdquo; This was spoken, as the honest lawyer himself
might have said, <i>in transitu</i>, the rest by the side of the carriage.
&ldquo;My stars, Mrs. Dods, and is this really your ain sell, <i>in propria
persona</i>?&mdash;Wha lookit for you at such a time of day?&mdash;Anthony, how's a'
wi' ye, Anthony?&mdash;so ye hae taen the road again, Anthony&mdash;help us down
wi' the apron, Anthony&mdash;that will do.&mdash;Lean on me, Mrs. Dods&mdash;help your
mistress, Anthony&mdash;put the horses in my stable&mdash;the lads will give you
the key.&mdash;Come away, Mrs. Dods&mdash;I am blithe to see you straight your
legs on the causeway of our auld borough again&mdash;come in by, and we'll
see to get you some breakfast, for ye hae been asteer early this
morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am a sair trouble to you, Mr. Bindloose,&rdquo; said the old lady,
accepting the offer of his arm, and accompanying him into the house; &ldquo;I
am e'en a sair trouble to you, but I could not rest till I had your
advice on something of moment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Happy will I be to serve you, my gude auld acquaintance,&rdquo; said the
Clerk; &ldquo;but sit you down&mdash;sit you<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_210" id="vol_i_Page_210">[Pg&nbsp;210]</a></span> down&mdash;sit you down, Mrs. Dods&mdash;meat
and mess never hindered wark. Ye are something overcome wi' your
travel&mdash;the spirit canna aye bear through the flesh, Mrs. Dods; ye
should remember that your life is a precious one, and ye should take
care of your health, Mrs. Dods.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My life precious!&rdquo; exclaimed Meg Dods; &ldquo;nane o' your whullywhaing, Mr.
Bindloose&mdash;Deil ane wad miss the auld girning alewife, Mr. Bindloose,
unless it were here and there a puir body, and maybe the auld
house-tyke, that wadna be sae weel guided, puir fallow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fie, fie! Mrs. Dods,&rdquo; said the Clerk, in a tone of friendly rebuke; &ldquo;it
vexes an auld friend to hear ye speak of yourself in that respectless
sort of a way; and, as for quitting us, I bless God I have not seen you
look better this half score of years. But maybe you will be thinking of
setting your house in order, which is the act of a carefu' and of a
Christian woman&mdash;O! it's an awfu' thing to die intestate, if we had
grace to consider it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aweel, I daur say I'll consider that some day soon, Mr. Bindloose; but
that's no my present errand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be it what it like, Mrs. Dods, ye are right heartily welcome here, and
we have a' the day to speak of the business in hand&mdash;<i>festina lente</i>,
that is the true law language&mdash;hooly and fairly, as one may say&mdash;ill
treating of business with an empty stomach&mdash;and here comes your tea, and
I hope Hannah has made it to your taste.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Meg sipped her tea&mdash;confessed Hannah's skill in the mysteries of the
Chinese herb&mdash;sipped again, then tried to eat a bit of bread and butter,
with very indifferent success; and notwithstanding the lawyer's
compliments to her good looks, seemed in reality, on the point of
becoming ill.<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_211" id="vol_i_Page_211">[Pg&nbsp;211]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;In the deil's name, what is the matter!&rdquo; said the lawyer, too well
read in a profession where sharp observation is peculiarly necessary, to
suffer these symptoms of agitation to escape him. &ldquo;Ay, dame? ye are
taking this business of yours deeper to heart than ever I kend you take
ony thing. Ony o' your banded debtors failed, or like to fail? What
then! cheer ye up&mdash;you can afford a little loss, and it canna be ony
great matter, or I would doubtless have heard of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In troth, but it <i>is</i> a loss, Mr. Bindloose; and what say ye to the
loss of a friend?&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was a possibility which had never entered the lawyer's long list of
calamities, and he was at some loss to conceive what the old lady could
possibly mean by so sentimental a prolusion. But just as he began to
come out with his &ldquo;Ay, ay, we are all mortal, <i>Vita incerta, mors
certissima!</i>&rdquo; and two or three more pithy reflections, which he was in
the habit of uttering after funerals, when the will of the deceased was
about to be opened,&mdash;just then Mrs. Dods was pleased to become the
expounder of her own oracle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see how it is, Mr. Bindloose,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I maun tell my ain ailment,
for you are no likely to guess it; and so, if ye will shut the door, and
see that nane of your giggling callants are listening in the passage, I
will e'en tell you how things stand with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Bindloose hastily arose to obey her commands, gave a cautionary
glance into the Bank-office, and saw that his idle apprentices were fast
at their desks&mdash;turned the key upon them, as if it were in <span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_212" id="vol_i_Page_212">[Pg&nbsp;212]</a></span>a fit of
absence, and then returned, not a little curious to know what could be
the matter with his old friend; and leaving off all further attempts to
put cases, quietly drew his chair near hers, and awaited her own time to
make her communication.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Bindloose,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I am no sure that you may mind, about six or
seven years ago, that there were twa daft English callants, lodgers of
mine, that had some trouble from auld St. Ronan's about shooting on the
Springwell-head muirs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mind it as weel as yesterday, Mistress,&rdquo; said the Clerk; &ldquo;by the same
token you gave me a note for my trouble, (which wasna worth speaking
about,) and bade me no bring in a bill against the puir bairns&mdash;ye had
aye a kind heart, Mrs. Dods.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe, and maybe no, Mr. Bindloose&mdash;that is just as I find folk.&mdash;But
concerning these lads, they baith left the country, and, as I think, in
some ill blude wi' ane another, and now the auldest and the doucest of
the twa came back again about a fortnight sin' syne, and has been my
guest ever since.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aweel, and I trust he is not at his auld tricks again, goodwife?&rdquo;
answered the Clerk. &ldquo;I havena sae muckle to say either wi' the new
Sheriff or the Bench of Justices as I used to hae, Mrs. Dods&mdash;and the
Procurator-fiscal is very severe on poaching, being borne out by the new
Association&mdash;few of our auld friends of the Killnakelty are able to come
to the sessions now, Mrs. Dods.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The waur for the country, Mr. Bindloose,&rdquo; replied the old lady&mdash;&ldquo;they
were decent, considerate men, that didna plague a puir herd callant
muckle about a moorfowl or a mawkin, unless<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_213" id="vol_i_Page_213">[Pg&nbsp;213]</a></span> he turned common fowler&mdash;Sir
Robert Ringhorse used to say, the herd lads shot as mony gleds and pyots
as they did game.&mdash;But new lords new laws&mdash;naething but fine and
imprisonment, and the game no a feather the plentier. If I wad hae a
brace or twa of birds in the house, as every body looks for them after
the twelfth&mdash;I ken what they are like to cost me&mdash;And what for no?&mdash;risk
maun be paid for.&mdash;There is John Pirner himsell, that has keepit the
muir-side thirty year in spite of a' the lairds in the country, shoots,
he tells me, now-a-days, as if he felt a rape about his neck.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It wasna about ony game business, then, that you wanted advice?&rdquo; said
Bindloose, who, though somewhat of a digresser himself, made little
allowance for the excursions of others from the subject in hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed is it no, Mr. Bindloose,&rdquo; said Meg; &ldquo;but it is e'en about this
unhappy callant that I spoke to you about.&mdash;Ye maun ken I have cleiket a
particular fancy to this lad, Francis Tirl&mdash;a fancy that whiles
surprises my very sell, Mr. Bindloose, only that there is nae sin in
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;None&mdash;none in the world, Mrs. Dods,&rdquo; said the lawyer, thinking at the
same time within his own mind, &ldquo;Oho! the mist begins to clear up&mdash;the
young poacher has hit the mark, I see&mdash;winged the old barren grey
hen!&mdash;ay, ay,&mdash;a marriage-contract, no doubt&mdash;but I maun gie her
line.&mdash;Ye are a wise woman, Mrs. Dods,&rdquo; he continued aloud, &ldquo;and can
doubtless consider the chances and the changes of human affairs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I could never have considered what has befallen this puir lad, Mr.
Bindloose,&rdquo; said Mrs. Dods, &ldquo;through the malice of wicked men.&mdash;He
lived, then, <span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_214" id="vol_i_Page_214">[Pg&nbsp;214]</a></span>at the Cleikum, as I tell you, for mair than a fortnight,
as quiet as a lamb on a lea-rig&mdash;a decenter lad never came within my
door&mdash;ate and drank eneugh for the gude of the house, and nae mair than
was for his ain gude, whether of body or soul&mdash;cleared his bills ilka
Saturday at e'en, as regularly as Saturday came round.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;An admirable customer, no doubt, Mrs. Dods,&rdquo; said the lawyer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never was the like of him for that matter,&rdquo; answered the honest dame.
&ldquo;But to see the malice of men!&mdash;some of thae landloupers and gill-flirts
down at the filthy puddle yonder, that they ca' the Waal, had heard of
this puir lad, and the bits of pictures that he made fashion of drawing,
and they maun cuitle him awa doun to the bottle, where mony a bonny
story they had clecked, Mr. Bindloose, baith of Mr. Tirl and of mysell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A Commissary Court business,&rdquo; said the writer, going off again upon a
false scent. &ldquo;I shall trim their jackets for them, Mrs. Dods, if you can
but bring tight evidence of the facts&mdash;I will soon bring them to fine
and palinode&mdash;I will make them repent meddling with your good name.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My gude name! What the sorrow is the matter wi' my name, Mr.
Bindloose?&rdquo; said the irritable client. &ldquo;I think ye hae been at the wee
cappie this morning, for as early as it is&mdash;My gude name!&mdash;if ony body
touched my gude name, I would neither fash counsel nor commissary&mdash;I wad
be down amang them, like a jer-falcon amang a wheen wild-geese, and the
best amang them that dared to say ony thing of Meg Dods by what was
honest and civil, I wad sune see if her cockernonnie was made of her ain
hair or other folk's. <i>My</i> gude name, indeed!&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_215" id="vol_i_Page_215">[Pg&nbsp;215]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Weel, weel, Mrs. Dods, I was mista'en, that's a',&rdquo; said the writer, &ldquo;I
was mista'en; and I dare to say you would haud your ain wi' your
neighbours as weel as ony woman in the land&mdash;But let us hear now what
the grief is, in one word.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In one word, then, Clerk Bindloose, it is little short of&mdash;murder,&rdquo;
said Meg, in a low tone, as if the very utterance of the word startled
her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Murder! murder, Mrs. Dods?&mdash;it cannot be&mdash;there is not a word of it in
the Sheriff-office&mdash;the Procurator-fiscal kens nothing of it&mdash;there
could not be murder in the country, and me not hear of it&mdash;for God's
sake, take heed what you say, woman, and dinna get yourself into
trouble.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Bindloose, I can but speak according to my lights,&rdquo; said Mrs. Dods;
&ldquo;you are in a sense a judge in Israel, at least you are one of the
scribes having authority&mdash;and I tell you, with a wae and bitter heart,
that this puir callant of mine that was lodging in my house has been
murdered or kidnapped awa amang thae banditti folk down at the New Waal;
and I'll have the law put in force against them, if it should cost me a
hundred pounds.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Clerk stood much astonished at the nature of Meg's accusation, and
the pertinacity with which she seemed disposed to insist upon it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have this comfort,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;that whatever has happened, it
has been by no fault of mine, Mr. Bindloose; for weel I wot, before that
bloodthirsty auld half-pay Philistine, MacTurk, got to speech of him, I
clawed his cantle to some purpose with my hearth-besom.&mdash;But the poor
simple bairn himsell, that had nae mair knowledge of the wickedness of
human nature than a calf has of a fle<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_216" id="vol_i_Page_216">[Pg&nbsp;216]</a></span>sher's gully, he threepit to see
the auld hardened bloodshedder, and trysted wi' him to meet wi' some of
the gang at an hour certain that same day, and awa he gaed to keep
tryst, but since that hour naebody ever has set een on him.&mdash;And the
mansworn villains now want to put a disgrace on him, and say that he
fled the country rather than face them!&mdash;a likely story&mdash;fled the
country for them!&mdash;and leave his bill unsettled&mdash;him that was sae
regular&mdash;and his portmantle and his fishing-rod and the pencils and
pictures he held sic a wark about!&mdash;It's my faithful belief, Mr.
Bindloose&mdash;and ye may trust me or no as ye like&mdash;that he had some foul
play between the Cleikum and the Buck-stane. I have thought it, and I
have dreamed it, and I will be at the bottom of it, or my name is not
Meg Dods, and that I wad have them a' to reckon on.&mdash;Ay, ay, that's
right, Mr. Bindloose, tak out your pen and inkhorn, and let us set about
it to purpose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With considerable difficulty, and at the expense of much
cross-examination, Mr. Bindloose extracted from his client a detailed
account of the proceedings of the company at the Well towards Tyrrel, so
far as they were known to, or suspected by Meg, making notes, as the
examination proceeded, of what appeared to be matter of consequence.
After a moment's consideration, he asked the dame the very natural
question, how she came to be acquainted with the material fact, that a
hostile appointment was made between Captain MacTurk and her lodger,
when, according to her own account, it was made <i>intra parietes</i>, and
<i>remotis testibus</i>?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, but we victuallers ken weel eneugh what goes on in our ain houses,&rdquo;
said Meg&mdash;&ldquo;And what for no?&mdash;If ye <i>maun</i> ken a' about it, I e'en
listened through the keyhole of the door<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_217" id="vol_i_Page_217">[Pg&nbsp;217]</a></span>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And do you say you heard them settle an appointment for a duel?&rdquo; said
the Clerk; &ldquo;and did you no take ony measures to hinder mischief, Mrs.
Dods, having such a respect for this lad as you say you have, Mrs.
Dods?&mdash;I really wadna have looked for the like o' this at your hands.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In truth, Mr. Bindloose,&rdquo; said Meg, putting her apron to her eyes, &ldquo;and
that's what vexes me mair than a' the rest, and ye needna say muckle to
ane whose heart is e'en the sairer that she has been a thought to blame.
But there has been mony a challenge, as they ca' it, passed in my house,
when thae daft lads of the Wildfire Club and the Helter-skelter were
upon their rambles; and they had aye sense eneugh to make it up without
fighting, sae that I really did not apprehend ony thing like
mischief.&mdash;And ye maun think, moreover, Mr. Bindloose, that it would
have been an unco thing if a guest, in a decent and creditable public
like mine, was to have cried coward before ony of thae landlouping
blackguards that live down at the hottle yonder.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is to say, Mrs. Dods, you were desirous your guest should fight
for the honour of your house,&rdquo; said Bindloose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What for no, Mr. Bindloose?&mdash;Isna that kind of fray aye about honour?
and what for should the honour of a substantial, four-nooked, sclated
house of three stories, no be foughten for, as weel as the credit of ony
of these feckless callants that make such a fray about their
reputation?&mdash;I promise you my house, the Cleikum, stood in the Auld Town
of St. Ronan's before they were born, and it will stand there after they
are hanged, as I trust some of them are like<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_218" id="vol_i_Page_218">[Pg&nbsp;218]</a></span> to be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, but perhaps your lodger had less zeal for the honour of the
house, and has quietly taken himself out of harm's way,&rdquo; said Mr.
Bindloose; &ldquo;for if I understand your story, this meeting never took
place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have less zeal!&rdquo; said Meg, determined to be pleased with no supposition
of her lawyer, &ldquo;Mr. Bindloose, ye little ken him&mdash;I wish ye had seen him
when he was angry!&mdash;I dared hardly face him mysell, and there are no
mony folk that I am feared for&mdash;Meeting! there was nae meeting, I
trow&mdash;they never dared to meet him fairly&mdash;but I am sure waur came of it
than ever would have come of a meeting; for Anthony heard twa shots gang
off as he was watering the auld naig down at the burn, and that is not
far frae the footpath that leads to the Buck-stane. I was angry at him
for no making on to see what the matter was, but he thought it was auld
Pirner out wi' the double barrel, and he wasna keen of making himself a
witness, in case he suld have been caa'd on in the Poaching Court.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the Sheriff-clerk, &ldquo;and I dare say he did hear a poacher
fire a couple of shots&mdash;nothing more likely. Believe me, Mrs. Dods, your
guest had no fancy for the party Captain MacTurk invited him to&mdash;and
being a quiet sort of man, he has just walked away to his own home, if
he has one&mdash;I am really sorry you have given yourself the trouble of
this long journey about so simple a matter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Dods remained with her eyes fixed on the ground in a very sullen
and discontented posture, and when she spoke, it was in a tone of
corresponding displeasure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aw<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_219" id="vol_i_Page_219">[Pg&nbsp;219]</a></span>eel&mdash;aweel&mdash;live and learn, they say&mdash;I thought I had a friend in
you, Mr. Bindloose&mdash;I am sure I aye took your part when folk miscaa'd
ye, and said ye were this, that, and the other thing, and little better
than an auld sneck-drawing loon, Mr. Bindloose.&mdash;And ye have aye keepit
my penny of money, though, nae doubt, Tam Turnpenny lives nearer me, and
they say he allows half a per cent mair than ye do if the siller lies,
and mine is but seldom steered.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But ye have not the Bank's security, madam,&rdquo; said Mr. Bindloose,
reddening. &ldquo;I say harm of nae man's credit&mdash;ill would it beseem me&mdash;but
there is a difference between Tam Turnpenny and the Bank, I trow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Weel, weel, Bank here Bank there, I thought I had a friend in you, Mr.
Bindloose; and here am I, come from my ain house all the way to yours
for sma' comfort, I think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My stars, madam,&rdquo; said the perplexed scribe, &ldquo;what would you have me to
do in such a blind story as yours, Mrs. Dods?&mdash;Be a thought
reasonable&mdash;consider that there is no <i>Corpus delicti</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>&ldquo;Corpus delicti?</i> and what's that?&rdquo; said Meg; &ldquo;something to be paid
for, nae doubt, for your hard words a' end in that.&mdash;And what for suld I
no have a Corpus delicti, or a Habeas Corpus, or ony other Corpus that I
like, sae lang as I am willing to lick and lay down the ready siller?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lord help and pardon us, Mrs. Dods,&rdquo; said the distressed agent, &ldquo;ye
mistake the matter a'thegether! When I say there is no Corpus delicti, I
mean to say there is no proof that a crime<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_220" id="vol_i_Page_220">[Pg&nbsp;220]</a></span> has been committed.&rdquo;<a name="vol_i_FNanchor_19_19" id="vol_i_FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#vol_i_Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>&ldquo;And does the man say that murder is not a crime, than?&rdquo; answered Meg,
who had taken her own view of the subject far too strongly to be
converted to any other&mdash;&ldquo;Weel I wot it's a crime, baith by the law of
God and man, and mony a pretty man has been strapped for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I ken all that very weel,&rdquo; answered the writer; &ldquo;but, my stars, Mrs.
Dods, there is nae evidence of murder in this case&mdash;nae proof that a man
has been slain&mdash;nae production of his dead body&mdash;and that is what we
call the Corpus delicti.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Weel, than, the deil lick it out of ye,&rdquo; said Meg, rising in wrath,
&ldquo;for I will awa hame again; and as for the puir lad's body, I'll hae it
fund, if it cost me turning the earth for three miles round wi' pick and
shool&mdash;if it were but to give the puir bairn Christian burial, and to
bring punishment on MacTurk and the murdering crew at the Waal, and to
shame an auld doited fule like yoursell, John Bindloose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She rose in wrath to call her vehicle; but it was neither the interest
nor the intention of the writer that his customer and he should part on
such indifferent terms. He implored her patience, and reminded her that
the horses, poor things, had just come off their stage&mdash;an argument
which sounded irresistible in the ears of the old she-publican, in whose
early education due care of the post-cattle mingled with the most sacred
duties. She therefore resumed her seat again in a sullen mood, and Mr.
Bindloos<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_221" id="vol_i_Page_221">[Pg&nbsp;221]</a></span>e was cudgelling his brains for some argument which might bring
the old lady to reason, when his attention was drawn by a noise in the
passage.</p>

<i>King John.</i><br />
</p>


<p>The noise stated at the conclusion of last chapter to have disturbed Mr.
Bindloose, was the rapping of one, as in haste and impatience, at the
Bank-office door, which office was an apartment of the Banker's house,
on the left hand of his passage, as the parlour in which he had received
Mrs. Dods was upon the right.</p>

<p>In general, this office was patent to all having business there; but at
present, whatever might be the hurry of the party who knocked, the
clerks within the office could not admit him, being themselves made
prisoners by the prudent jealousy of Mr. Bindloose, to prevent them from
listening to his consultation with Mrs. Dods. They therefore answered
the angry and impatient knocking of the stranger only with stifled
giggling from within, finding it no doubt an excellent joke, that their
master's precaution was thus interfering with their own discharge of
duty.</p>

<p>With one or two hearty curses upon them, as the regula<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_222" id="vol_i_Page_222">[Pg&nbsp;222]</a></span>r plagues of his
life, Mr. Bindloose darted into the passage, and admitted the stranger
into his official apartment. The doors both of the parlour and office
remaining open, the ears of Luckie Dods (experienced, as the reader
knows, in collecting intelligence) could partly overhear what passed.
The conversation seemed to regard a cash transaction of some importance,
as Meg became aware when the stranger raised a voice which was naturally
sharp and high, as he did when uttering the following words, towards the
close of a conversation which had lasted about five
minutes&mdash;&ldquo;Premium?&mdash;Not a pice, sir&mdash;not a courie&mdash;not a
farthing&mdash;premium for a Bank of England bill?&mdash;d'ye take me for a fool,
sir?&mdash;do not I know that you call forty days par when you give
remittances to London?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Bindloose was here heard to mutter something indistinctly about the
custom of the trade.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Custom!&rdquo; retorted the stranger, &ldquo;no such thing&mdash;damn'd bad custom, if
it is one&mdash;don't tell me of customs&mdash;'Sbodikins, man, I know the rate of
exchange all over the world, and have drawn bills from Timbuctoo&mdash;My
friends in the Strand filed it along with Bruce's from Gondar&mdash;talk to
me of premium on a Bank of England post-bill!&mdash;What d'ye look at the
bill for?&mdash;D'ye think it doubtful&mdash;I can change it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By no means necessary,&rdquo; answered Bindloose, &ldquo;the bill is quite right;
but it is usual to indorse, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly&mdash;reach me a pen&mdash;d'ye think I can write with my rattan?&mdash;What
sort of ink is this?&mdash;yellow as curry sauce&mdash;never mind&mdash;there is my
name&mdash;Peregrine Touchwood&mdash;I got it from the Willoughbies, my Christian
name&mdash;Have I my full change here?&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_223" id="vol_i_Page_223">[Pg&nbsp;223]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Your full change, sir,&rdquo; answered Bindloose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, you should give <i>me</i> a premium, friend, instead of me giving you
one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is out of our way, I assure you, sir,&rdquo; said the Banker, &ldquo;quite out
of our way&mdash;but if you would step into the parlour and take a cup of
tea&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, ay,&rdquo; said the stranger, his voice sounding more distinctly as
(talking all the while, and ushered along by Mr. Bindloose) he left the
office and moved towards the parlour, &ldquo;a cup of tea were no such bad
thing, if one could come by it genuine&mdash;but as for your premium&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;So
saying, he entered the parlour and made his bow to Mrs. Dods, who,
seeing what she called a decent, purpose-like body, and aware that his
pocket was replenished with English and Scottish paper currency,
returned the compliment with her best curtsy.</p>

<p>Mr. Touchwood, when surveyed more at leisure, was a short, stout, active
man, who, though sixty years of age and upwards, retained in his sinews
and frame the elasticity of an earlier period. His countenance expressed
self-confidence, and something like a contempt for those who had neither
seen nor endured so much as he had himself. His short black hair was
mingled with grey, but not entirely whitened by it. His eyes were
jet-black, deep-set, small, and sparkling, and contributed, with a short
turned-up nose, to express an irritable and choleric habit. His
complexion was burnt to a brick-colour by the vicissitudes of climate,
to which it had been subjected; and his face, which at the distance of a
yard or two seemed hale and smooth, a<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_224" id="vol_i_Page_224">[Pg&nbsp;224]</a></span>ppeared, when closely examined, to
be seamed with a million of wrinkles, crossing each other in every
direction possible, but as fine as if drawn by the point of a very
small needle.<a name="vol_i_FNanchor_20_20" id="vol_i_FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#vol_i_Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> His dress was a blue coat and buff waistcoat, half
boots remarkably well blacked, and a silk handkerchief tied with
military precision. The only antiquated part of his dress was a cocked
hat of equilateral dimensions, in the button-hole of which he wore a
very small cockade. Mrs. Dods, accustomed to judge of persons by their
first appearance, said, that in the three steps which he made from the
door to the tea-table, she recognised, without the possibility of
mistake, the gait of a person who was well to pass in the world; &ldquo;and
that,&rdquo; she added with a wink, &ldquo;is what we victuallers are seldom
deceived in. If a gold-laced waistcoat has an empty pouch, the plain
swan's-down will be the brawer of the twa.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A drizzling morning, good madam,&rdquo; said Mr. Touchwood, as with a view of
sounding what sort of company he had got into.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A fine saft morning for the crap, sir,&rdquo; answered Mrs. Dods, with equal
solemnity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Right, my good madam; <i>soft</i> is the very word, though it has been some
time since I heard it. I have cast a double hank about the round world
since I last heard of a soft<a name="vol_i_FNanchor_21_21" id="vol_i_FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#vol_i_Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will be from these parts, then?&rdquo; said the writer, ingeniously
putting a case, which, he hoped, would induce the stranger<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_225" id="vol_i_Page_225">[Pg&nbsp;225]</a></span> to explain
himself. &ldquo;And yet, sir,&rdquo; he added, after a pause, &ldquo;I was thinking that
Touchwood is not a Scottish name, at least that I ken of.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Scottish name?&mdash;no,&rdquo; replied the traveller; &ldquo;but a man may have been in
these parts before, without being a native&mdash;or, being a native, he may
have had some reason to change his name&mdash;there are many reasons why men
change their names.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly, and some of them very good ones,&rdquo; said the lawyer; &ldquo;as in
the common case of an heir of entail, where deed of provision and
tailzie is maist ordinarily implemented by taking up name and arms.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, or in the case of a man having made the country too hot for him
under his own proper appellative,&rdquo; said Mr. Touchwood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is a supposition, sir,&rdquo; replied the lawyer, &ldquo;which it would ill
become me to put.&mdash;But at any rate, if you knew this country formerly,
ye cannot but be marvellously pleased with the change we have been
making since the American war&mdash;hill-sides bearing clover instead of
heather&mdash;rents doubled, trebled, quadrupled&mdash;the auld reekie dungeons
pulled down, and gentlemen living in as good houses as you will see any
where in England.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Much good may it do them, for a pack of fools!&rdquo; replied Mr. Touchwood,
hastily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You do not seem much delighted with our improvements, sir?&rdquo; said the
banker, astonished to hear a dissentient voice where he conceived all
men were unanimous.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pleased!&rdquo; answered the stranger&mdash;&ldquo;Yes, as much pleased as I am with the
devil, who I believe set many of them agoing. Ye have got an idea that
every thing must be changed&mdash;Unstable a<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_226" id="vol_i_Page_226">[Pg&nbsp;226]</a></span>s water, ye shall not excel&mdash;I
tell ye, there have been more changes in this poor nook of yours within
the last forty years, than in the great empires of the East for the
space of four thousand, for what I know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And why not,&rdquo; replied Bindloose, &ldquo;if they be changes for the better?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But they are <i>not</i> for the better,&rdquo; replied Mr. Touchwood, eagerly. &ldquo;I
left your peasantry as poor as rats indeed, but honest and industrious,
enduring their lot in this world with firmness, and looking forward to
the next with hope&mdash;Now they are mere eye-servants&mdash;looking at their
watches, forsooth, every ten minutes, lest they should work for their
master half an instant after loosing-time&mdash;And then, instead of studying
the Bible on the work days, to kittle the clergymen with doubtful points
of controversy on the Sabbath, they glean all their theology from Tom
Paine and Voltaire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Weel I wot the gentleman speaks truth,&rdquo; said Mrs. Dods. &ldquo;I fand a
bundle of their bawbee blasphemies in my ain kitchen&mdash;But I trow I made
a clean house of the packman loon that brought them!&mdash;No content wi'
turning the tawpies' heads wi' ballants, and driving them daft wi'
ribands, to cheat them out of their precious souls, and gie them the
deevil's ware, that I suld say sae, in exchange for the siller that suld
support their puir father that's aff wark and bedridden!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Father! madam,&rdquo; said the stranger; &ldquo;they think no more of their father
than Regan or Goneril.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In gude troth, ye have skeel of our sect, sir,&rdquo; replied the dame; &ldquo;they
are gomerils, every one of them&mdash;I tell them sae every hour of the day,
but catch them profiting by the doctrine.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_227" id="vol_i_Page_227">[Pg&nbsp;227]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;And then the brutes are turned mercenary, madam,&rdquo; said Mr. Touchwood,
&ldquo;I remember when a Scottishman would have scorned to touch a shilling
that he had not earned, and yet was as ready to help a stranger as an
Arab of the desert. And now, I did but drop my cane the other day as I
was riding&mdash;a fellow who was working at the hedge made three steps to
lift it&mdash;I thanked him, and my friend threw his hat on his head, and
&lsquo;damned my thanks, if that were all&rsquo;&mdash;Saint Giles could not have
excelled him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Weel, weel,&rdquo; said the banker, &ldquo;that may be a' as you say, sir, and nae
doubt wealth makes wit waver; but the country's wealthy, that cannot be
denied, and wealth, sir, ye ken&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know wealth makes itself wings,&rdquo; answered the cynical stranger; &ldquo;but
I am not quite sure we have it even now. You make a great show, indeed,
with building and cultivation; but stock is not capital, any more than
the fat of a corpulent man is health or strength.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Surely, Mr. Touchwood,&rdquo; said Bindloose, who felt his own account in the
modern improvements, &ldquo;a set of landlords, living like lairds in good
earnest, and tenants with better housekeeping than the lairds used to
have, and facing Whitsunday and Martinmas as I would face my
breakfast&mdash;if these are not signs of wealth, I do not know where to seek
for them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are signs of folly, sir,&rdquo; replied Touchwood; &ldquo;folly that is poor,
and renders itself poorer by desiring to be thought rich; and how they
come by the means they are so ostentatious of, you, who are a banker,
perhaps can tell me better than I can guess.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_228" id="vol_i_Page_228">[Pg&nbsp;228]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;There is maybe an accommodation bill discounted now and then, Mr.
Touchwood; but men must have accommodation, or the world would stand
still&mdash;accommodation is the grease that makes the wheels go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, makes them go down hill to the devil,&rdquo; answered Touchwood. &ldquo;I left
you bothered about one Ayr bank, but the whole country is an Air bank
now, I think&mdash;And who is to pay the piper?&mdash;But it's all one&mdash;I will see
little more of it&mdash;it is a perfect Babel, and would turn the head of a
man who has spent his life with people who love sitting better than
running, silence better than speaking, who never eat but when they are
hungry, never drink but when thirsty, never laugh without a jest, and
never speak but when they have something to say. But here, it is all
run, ride, and drive&mdash;froth, foam, and flippancy&mdash;no steadiness&mdash;no
character.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'll lay the burden of my life,&rdquo; said Dame Dods, looking towards her
friend Bindloose, &ldquo;that the gentleman has been at the new Spaw-waal
yonder!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Spaw do you call it, madam?&mdash;If you mean the new establishment that has
been spawned down yonder at St. Ronan's, it is the very fountain-head of
folly and coxcombry&mdash;a Babel for noise, and a Vanity-fair for
nonsense&mdash;no well in your swamps tenanted by such a conceited colony of
clamorous frogs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir, sir!&rdquo; exclaimed Dame Dods, delighted with the unqualified sentence
passed upon her fashionable rivals, and eager to testify her respect for
the judicious stranger who had pronounced it,&mdash;&ldquo;will you let me have the
pleasure of pouring you out a dish of tea?&rdquo; And so saying, she took
bustling possession of the administration which had hitherto remained in
the hands of Mr. Bindloose himself.<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_229" id="vol_i_Page_229">[Pg&nbsp;229]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope it is to your taste, sir,&rdquo; she continued, when the traveller
had accepted her courtesy with the grateful acknowledgment, which men
addicted to speak a great deal usually show to a willing auditor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is as good as we have any right to expect, ma'am,&rdquo; answered Mr.
Touchwood; &ldquo;not quite like what I have drunk at Canton with old Fong
Qua&mdash;but the Celestial Empire does not send its best tea to Leadenhall
Street, nor does Leadenhall Street send its best to Marchthorn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That may be very true, sir,&rdquo; replied the dame; &ldquo;but I will venture to
say that Mr. Bindloose's tea is muckle better than you had at the
Spaw-waal yonder.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tea, madam!&mdash;I saw none&mdash;Ash leaves and black-thorn leaves were brought
in in painted canisters, and handed about by powder-monkeys in livery,
and consumed by those who liked it, amidst the chattering of parrots and
the squalling of kittens. I longed for the days of the Spectator, when I
might have laid my penny on the bar, and retired without ceremony&mdash;But
no&mdash;this blessed decoction was circulated under the auspices of some
half-crazed blue-stocking or other, and we were saddled with all the
formality of an entertainment, for this miserable allowance of a
cockle-shell full of cat-lap per head.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Weel, sir,&rdquo; answered Dame Dods, &ldquo;all I can say is, that if it had been
my luck to have served you at the Cleikum Inn, which our folk have kept
for these twa generations, I canna pretend to say ye should have had
such tea as ye have been used to in foreign parts where it grows, but
the best I <span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_230" id="vol_i_Page_230">[Pg&nbsp;230]</a></span>had I wad have gi'en it to a gentleman of your appearance,
and I never charged mair than six-pence in all my time, and my father's
before me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish I had known the Old Inn was still standing, madam,&rdquo; said the
traveller; &ldquo;I should certainly have been your guest, and sent down for
the water every morning&mdash;the doctors insist I must use Cheltenham, or
some substitute, for the bile&mdash;though, d&mdash;n them, I believe it's only
to hide their own ignorance. And I thought this Spaw would have been the
least evil of the two; but I have been fairly overreached&mdash;one might as
well live in the inside of a bell. I think young St. Ronan's must be
mad, to have established such a Vanity-fair upon his father's old
property.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you ken this St. Ronan's that now is?&rdquo; enquired the dame.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By report only,&rdquo; said Mr. Touchwood; &ldquo;but I have heard of the family,
and I think I have read of them, too, in Scottish history. I am sorry to
understand they are lower in the world than they have been. This young
man does not seem to take the best way to mend matters, spending his
time among gamblers and black-legs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should be sorry if it were so,&rdquo; said honest Meg Dods, whose
hereditary respect for the family always kept her from joining in any
scandal affecting the character of the young Laird&mdash;&ldquo;My forbears, sir,
have had kindness frae his; and although maybe he may have forgotten all
about it, it wad ill become me to say ony thing of him that should not
be said of his father's son.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Bindloose had not the same motive for forbearance; he declaimed
against Mowbray as a thoughtless dissipater of his own fortune, and that
of others. <span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_231" id="vol_i_Page_231">[Pg&nbsp;231]</a></span>&ldquo;I have some reason to speak,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;having two of his
notes for L.100 each, which I discounted out of mere kindness and
respect for his ancient family, and which he thinks nae mair of
retiring, than he does of paying the national debt&mdash;And here has he been
raking every shop in Marchthorn, to fit out an entertainment for all the
fine folk at the Well yonder; and tradesfolk are obliged to take his
acceptances for their furnishings. But they may cash his bills that
will; I ken ane that will never advance a bawbee on ony paper that has
John Mowbray either on the back or front of it. He had mair need to be
paying the debts which he has made already, than making new anes, that
he may feed fules and flatterers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe he is likely to lose his preparations, too,&rdquo; said Mr.
Touchwood, &ldquo;for the entertainment has been put off, as I heard, in
consequence of Miss Mowbray's illness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay, puir thing!&rdquo; said Dame Margaret Dods: &ldquo;her health has been
unsettled for this mony a day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Something wrong here, they tell me,&rdquo; said the traveller, pointing to
his own forehead significantly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;God only kens,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Dods; &ldquo;but I rather suspect the heart than
the head&mdash;the puir thing is hurried here and there, and down to the
Waal, and up again, and nae society or quiet at hame; and a' thing
ganging this unthrifty gait&mdash;nae wonder she is no that weel settled.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; replied Touchwood, &ldquo;she is worse they say than she has been, and
that has occasioned the party at Shaws-Castle having been put off.
Besides, now this fine young lord has come down to the Well, undoubtedly
they will wait her recovery.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A lord!&rdquo; ejaculated the astonished Mrs. <span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_232" id="vol_i_Page_232">[Pg&nbsp;232]</a></span>Dods; &ldquo;a lord come down to the
Waal&mdash;they will be neither to haud nor to bind now&mdash;ance wud and aye
waur&mdash;a lord!&mdash;set them up and shute them forward&mdash;a lord!&mdash;the Lord
have a care o' us!&mdash;a lord at the hottle!&mdash;Maister Touchwood, it's my
mind he will only prove to be a Lord o' Session.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, not so, my good lady,&rdquo; replied the traveller &ldquo;he is an English
lord, and, as they say, a Lord of Parliament&mdash;but some folk pretend to
say there is a flaw in the title.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'll warrant is there&mdash;a dozen of them!&rdquo; said Meg, with alacrity&mdash;for
she could by no means endure to think on the accumulation of dignity
likely to accrue to the rival establishment, from its becoming the
residence of an actual nobleman. &ldquo;I'll warrant he'll prove a landlouping
lord on their hand, and they will be e'en cheap o' the loss&mdash;And he has
come down out of order it's like, and nae doubt he'll no be lang there
before he will recover his health, for the credit of the Spaw.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Faith, madam, his present disorder is one which the Spaw will hardly
cure&mdash;he is shot in the shoulder with a pistol-bullet&mdash;a robbery
attempted, it seems&mdash;that is one of your new accomplishments&mdash;no such
thing happened in Scotland in my time&mdash;men would have sooner expected to
meet with the ph&oelig;nix than with a highwayman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And where did this happen, if you please, sir?&rdquo; asked the man of bills.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Somewhere near the old village,&rdquo; replied the stranger; &ldquo;and, if I am
rightly informed, on Wednesday last.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This explains your twa shots, I am thinking, Mrs. Dods,&rdquo; said Mr.
Bindloose; &ldquo;your groom heard them on the Wednesday&mdash;it must have been
this attack on the stranger nobleman.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_233" id="vol_i_Page_233">[Pg&nbsp;233]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe it was, and maybe it was not,&rdquo; said Mrs. Dods; &ldquo;but I'll see gude
reason before I give up my ain judgment in that case.&mdash;I wad like to
ken if this gentleman,&rdquo; she added, returning to the subject from which
Mr. Touchwood's interesting conversation had for a few minutes diverted
her thoughts, &ldquo;has heard aught of Mr. Tirl?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you mean the person to whom this paper relates,&rdquo; said the stranger,
taking a printed handbill from his pocket, &ldquo;I heard of little else&mdash;the
whole place rang of him, till I was almost as sick of Tyrrel as William
Rufus was. Some idiotical quarrel which he had engaged in, and which he
had not fought out, as their wisdom thought he should have done, was the
principal cause of censure. That is another folly now, which has gained
ground among you. Formerly, two old proud lairds, or cadets of good
family, perhaps, quarrelled, and had a rencontre, or fought a duel after
the fashion of their old Gothic ancestors; but men who had no
grandfathers never dreamt of such folly&mdash;And here the folk denounce a
trumpery dauber of canvass, for such I understand to be this hero's
occupation, as if he were a field-officer, who made valour his
profession; and who, if you deprived him of his honour, was like to be
deprived of his bread at the same time.&mdash;Ha, ha, ha! it reminds one of
Don Quixote, who took his neighbour, Samson Carrasco, for a
knight-errant.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The perusal of this paper, which contained the notes formerly laid
before the reader, containing the statement of Sir Bingo, and the
censure which the company at the Well had thought fit to pass upon his
affair with Mr. Tyrrel<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_234" id="vol_i_Page_234">[Pg&nbsp;234]</a></span>, induced Mr. Bindloose to say to Mrs. Dods, with
as little exultation on the superiority of his own judgment as human
nature would permit,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye see now that I was right, Mrs. Dods, and that there was nae earthly
use in your fashing yoursell wi' this lang journey&mdash;The lad had just
ta'en the bent rather than face Sir Bingo; and troth, I think him the
wiser of the twa for sae doing&mdash;There ye hae print for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Meg answered somewhat sullenly, &ldquo;Ye may be mista'en, for a' that, your
ainsell, for as wise as ye are, Mr. Bindloose; I shall hae that matter
mair strictly enquired into.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This led to a renewal of the altercation concerning the probable fate of
Tyrrel, in the course of which the stranger was induced to take some
interest in the subject.</p>

<p>At length Mrs. Dods, receiving no countenance from the experienced
lawyer for the hypothesis she had formed, rose, in something like
displeasure, to order her whiskey to be prepared. But hostess as she was
herself, when in her own dominions, she reckoned without her host in the
present instance; for the humpbacked postilion, as absolute in his
department as Mrs. Dods herself, declared that the cattle would not be
fit for the road these two hours yet. The good lady was therefore
obliged to wait his pleasure, bitterly lamenting all the while the loss
which a house of public entertainment was sure to sustain by the absence
of the landlord or landlady, and anticipating a long list of broken
dishes, miscalculated reckonings, unarranged chambers, and other
disasters, which she was to expect at her return. Mr. Bindloose, zealous
to recover the regard of his good friend and client, which he had in
some degree f<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_235" id="vol_i_Page_235">[Pg&nbsp;235]</a></span>orfeited by contradicting her on a favourite subject, did
not choose to offer the unpleasing, though obvious topic of consolation,
that an unfrequented inn is little exposed to the accidents she
apprehended. On the contrary, he condoled with her very cordially, and
went so far as to hint, that if Mr. Touchwood had come to Marchthorn
with post-horses, as he supposed from his dress, she could have the
advantage of them to return with more despatch to St. Ronan's.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not sure,&rdquo; said Mr. Touchwood, suddenly, &ldquo;but I may return there
myself. In that case I will be glad to set this good lady down, and to
stay a few days at her house if she will receive me.&mdash;I respect a woman
like you, ma'am, who pursue the occupation of your father&mdash;I have been
in countries, ma'am, where people have followed the same trade, from
father to son, for thousands of years&mdash;And I like the fashion&mdash;it shows
a steadiness and sobriety of character.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Dods put on a joyous countenance at this proposal, protesting that
all should be done in her power to make things agreeable; and while her
good friend, Mr. Bindloose, expatiated upon the comfort her new guest
would experience at the Cleikum, she silently contemplated with delight
the prospect of a speedy and dazzling triumph, by carrying off a
creditable customer from her showy and successful rival at the Well.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall be easily accommodated, ma'am,&rdquo; said the stranger; &ldquo;I have
travelled too much and too far to be troublesome. A Spanish venta, a
Persian khan, or a Turkish caravanserail, is all the same to me&mdash;only,
as I have no servant&mdash;indeed, never can be plagued with one of these
idle loiterers,&mdash;I must beg yo<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_236" id="vol_i_Page_236">[Pg&nbsp;236]</a></span>u will send to the Well for a bottle of
the water on such mornings as I cannot walk there myself&mdash;I find it is
really of some service to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Dods readily promised compliance with this reasonable request;
graciously conceding, that there &ldquo;could be nae ill in the water itsell,
but maybe some gude&mdash;it was only the New Inn, and the daft haverils that
they caa'd the Company, that she misliked. Folk had a jest that St.
Ronan dookit the Deevil in the Waal, which garr'd it taste aye since of
brimstane&mdash;but she dared to say that was a' papist nonsense, for she was
tell't by him that kend weel, and that was the minister himsell, that
St. Ronan was nane of your idolatrous Roman saunts, but a Chaldee,&rdquo;
(meaning probably a Culdee,) &ldquo;whilk was doubtless a very different
story.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Matters being thus arranged to the satisfaction of both parties, the
post-chaise was ordered, and speedily appeared at the door of Mr.
Bindloose's mansion. It was not without a private feeling of reluctance,
that honest Meg mounted the step of a vehicle, on the door of which was
painted, &ldquo;<span class="smcap">Fox Inn and Hotel, St. Ronan's Well</span>;&rdquo; but it was too late to
start such scruples.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never thought to have entered ane o' their hurley-hackets,&rdquo; she said,
as she seated herself; &ldquo;and sic a like thing as it is&mdash;scarce room for
twa folk!&mdash;Weel I wot, Mr. Touchwood, when I was in the hiring line, our
twa chaises wad hae carried, ilk ane o' them, four grown folk and as
mony bairns. I trust that doited creature Anthony will come awa back wi'
my whiskey and the cattle, as soon as they have had their feed.&mdash;Are ye
sure ye hae room eneugh, sir?&mdash;I wad fain hotch mysell farther yont.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, ma'<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_237" id="vol_i_Page_237">[Pg&nbsp;237]</a></span>am,&rdquo; answered the Oriental, &ldquo;I am accustomed to all sorts of
conveyances&mdash;a dooly, a litter, a cart, a palanquin, or a post-chaise,
are all alike to me&mdash;I think I could be an inside with Queen Mab in <span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_238" id="vol_i_Page_238">[Pg&nbsp;238]</a></span>a
nutshell, rather than not get forward.&mdash;Begging you many pardons, if you
have no particular objections, I will light my sheroot,&rdquo; &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A man he was to all the country dear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And passing rich with forty pounds a-year.<br /></span>

<p class="citation">
<span class="smcap">Goldsmith</span>'s <i>Deserted Village</i>.<br />
</p>


<p>Mrs. Dods's conviction, that her friend Tyrrel had been murdered by the
sanguinary Captain MacTurk remained firm and unshaken; but some
researches for the supposed body having been found fruitless, as well as
expensive, she began to give up the matter in despair. &ldquo;She had done her
duty&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;she left the matter to them that had a charge anent such
things&rdquo;&mdash;and &ldquo;Providence would bring the mystery to light in his own
fitting time&rdquo;&mdash;such were the moralities with which the good dame
consoled herself; and, with less obstinacy than Mr. Bindloose had
expected, she retained her opinion without changing her banker and man
of business.</p>

<p>Perhaps Meg's acquiescent inactivity in a matter which she had
threatened to probe so deeply, was partly owing to the place of poor
Tyrrel being supplied in her blue chamber, and in her daily thoughts and
cares, by her new guest, Mr. Touchwood; in possessing whom, a deserter
as he was from the Well, she obtained, according to her view of the
matter, a <span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_239" id="vol_i_Page_239">[Pg&nbsp;239]</a></span>decided triumph over her rivals. It sometimes required,
however, the full force of this reflection, to induce Meg, old and
crabbed as she was, to submit to the various caprices and exactions of
attention which were displayed by her new lodger. Never any man talked
so much as Touchwood, of his habitual indifference to food, and
accommodation in travelling; and probably there never was any traveller
who gave more trouble in a house of entertainment. He had his own whims
about cookery; and when these were contradicted, especially if he felt
at the same time a twinge of incipient gout, one would have thought he
had taken his lessons in the pastry-shop of Bedreddin Hassan, and was
ready to renew the scene of the unhappy cream-tart, which was compounded
without pepper. Every now and then he started some new doctrine in
culinary matters, which Mrs. Dods deemed a heresy; and then the very
house rang with their disputes. Again, his bed must necessarily be made
at a certain angle from the pillow to the footposts; and the slightest
deviation from this disturbed, he said, his nocturnal rest, and did
certainly ruffle his temper. He was equally whimsical about the brushing
of his clothes, the arrangement of the furniture in his apartment, and a
thousand minuti&aelig;, which, in conversation, he seemed totally to contemn.</p>

<p>It may seem singular, but such is the inconsistency of human nature,
that a guest of this fanciful and capricious disposition gave much more
satisfaction to Mrs. Dods, than her quiet and indifferent friend, Mr.
Tyrrel. If her present lodger could blame, he could also applaud; and no
artist, conscious of such skill as Mrs. Dods possessed, is i<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_240" id="vol_i_Page_240">[Pg&nbsp;240]</a></span>ndifferent
to the praises of such a connoisseur as Mr. Touchwood. The pride of art
comforted her for the additional labour; nor was it a matter unworthy
of this most honest publican's consideration, that the guests who give
most trouble, are usually those who incur the largest bills, and pay
them with the best grace. On this point Touchwood was a jewel of a
customer. He never denied himself the gratification of the slightest
whim, whatever expense he might himself incur, or whatever trouble he
might give to those about him; and all was done under protestation, that
the matter in question was the most indifferent thing to him in the
world. &ldquo;What the devil did he care for Burgess's sauces, he that had eat
his kouscousou, spiced with nothing but the sand of the desert? only it
was a shame for Mrs. Dods to be without what every decent house, above
the rank of an alehouse, ought to be largely provided with.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In short, he fussed, fretted, commanded, and was obeyed; kept the house
in hot water, and yet was so truly good-natured when essential matters
were in discussion, that it was impossible to bear him the least
ill-will; so that Mrs. Dods, though in a moment of spleen she sometimes
wished him at the top of Tintock,<a name="vol_i_FNanchor_F_29" id="vol_i_FNanchor_F_29"></a><a href="#vol_i_Footnote_F_29" class="fnanchor">[F]</a> always ended by singing forth his
praises. She could not, indeed, help suspecting that he was a Nabob, as
well from his conversation about foreign parts, as from his freaks of
indulgence to himself, and generosity to others,&mdash;attributes which she
understood to be proper to most &ldquo;Men of Ind.&rdquo; But although the reader
has heard her testify a general dislike to this species of Fortune's
favourites, Mrs. Dods had sense enough to know, that a Nabob living in
the<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_241" id="vol_i_Page_241">[Pg&nbsp;241]</a></span> neighbourhood, who raises the price of eggs and poultry upon the
good housewives around, was very different from a Nabob residing within
her own gates, drawing all his supplies from her own larder, and
paying, without hesitation or question, whatever bills her conscience
permitted her to send in. In short, to come back to the point at which
we perhaps might have stopped some time since, landlady and guest were
very much pleased with each other.</p>

<p>But Ennui finds entrance into every scene, when the gloss of novelty is
over; and the fiend began to seize upon Mr. Touchwood just when he had
got all matters to his mind in the Cleikum Inn&mdash;had instructed Dame Dods
in the mysteries of curry and mullegatawny&mdash;drilled the chambermaid into
the habit of making his bed at the angle recommended by Sir John
Sinclair&mdash;and made some progress in instructing the humpbacked postilion
in the Arabian mode of grooming. Pamphlets and newspapers, sent from
London and from Edinburgh by loads, proved inadequate to rout this
invader of Mr. Touchwood's comfort; and, at last, he bethought himself
of company. The natural resource would have been the Well&mdash;but the
traveller had a holy shivering of awe, which crossed him at the very
recollection of Lady Penelope, who had worked him rather hard during his
former brief residence; and although Lady Binks's beauty might have
charmed an Asiatic, by the plump graces of its contour, our senior was
past the thoughts of a Sultana and a haram. At length a bright idea
crossed his mind, and he suddenly demanded of Mrs. Dods, who was pouring
out his tea for breakfast, into a large cup of<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_242" id="vol_i_Page_242">[Pg&nbsp;242]</a></span> a very particular species
of china, of which he had presented her with a service on condition of
her rendering him this personal good office,&mdash;&ldquo;Pray, Mrs. Dods, what
sort of a man is your minister?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He's just a man like other men, Maister Touchwood,&rdquo; replied Meg; &ldquo;what
sort of a man should he be?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A man like other men?&mdash;ay&mdash;that is to say, he has the usual complement
of legs and arms, eyes and ears&mdash;But is he a sensible man?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No muckle o' that, sir,&rdquo; answered Dame Dods; &ldquo;for if he was drinking
this very tea that ye gat doun from London wi' the mail, he wad mistake
it for common bohea.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then he has not all his organs&mdash;wants a nose, or the use of one at
least,&rdquo; said Mr. Touchwood; &ldquo;the tea is right gunpowder&mdash;a perfect
nosegay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aweel, that may be,&rdquo; said the landlady; &ldquo;but I have gi'en the minister
a dram frae my ain best bottle of real Coniac brandy, and may I never
stir frae the bit, if he didna commend my whisky when he set down the
glass! There is no ane o' them in the Presbytery but himsell&mdash;ay, or in
the Synod either&mdash;but wad hae kend whisky frae brandy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what <i>sort</i> of man is he?&mdash;Has he learning?&rdquo; demanded Touchwood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Learning?&mdash;eneugh o' that,&rdquo; answered Meg; &ldquo;just dung donnart wi'
learning&mdash;lets a' things about the Manse gang whilk gate they will, sae
they dinna plague him upon the score. An awfu' thing it is to see sic an
ill-red-up house!&mdash;If I had the twa tawpies that sorn upon the honest
man ae week under my drilling, I think I wad show them how to sort a
lodging!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does he preach well?&rdquo; asked the guest.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_243" id="vol_i_Page_243">[Pg&nbsp;243]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, weel eneugh, weel eneugh&mdash;sometimes he will fling in a lang word or
a bit of learning that our farmers and bannet lairds canna sae weel
follow&mdash;But what of that, as I am aye telling them?&mdash;them that pay
stipend get aye the mair for their siller.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does he attend to his parish?&mdash;Is he kind to the poor?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ower muckle o' that, Maister Touchwood&mdash;I am sure he makes the Word
gude, and turns not away from those that ask o' him&mdash;his very pocket is
picked by a wheen ne'er-do-weel blackguards, that gae sorning through
the country.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sorning through the country, Mrs. Dods?&mdash;what would you think if you
had seen the Fakirs, the Dervises, the Bonzes, the Imaums, the monks,
and the mendicants, that I have seen?&mdash;But go on, never mind&mdash;Does this
minister of yours come much into company?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Company?&mdash;gae wa',&rdquo; replied Meg, &ldquo;he keeps nae company at a', neither
in his ain house or ony gate else. He comes down in the morning in a
lang ragged nightgown, like a potato bogle, and down he sits amang his
books; and if they dinna bring him something to eat, the puir demented
body has never the heart to cry for aught, and he has been kend to sit
for ten hours thegither, black fasting, whilk is a' mere papistrie,
though he does it just out o' forget.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, landlady, in that case, your parson is any thing but the ordinary
kind of man you described him&mdash;Forget his dinner!&mdash;the man must be
mad&mdash;he shall dine with me to-day&mdash;he shall have such a dinner as I'll
be bound he won't forget in a hurry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye'll ma<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_244" id="vol_i_Page_244">[Pg&nbsp;244]</a></span>ybe find that easier said than dune,&rdquo; said Mrs. Dods; &ldquo;the
honest man hasna, in a sense, the taste of his mouth&mdash;forby, he never
dines out of his ain house&mdash;that is, when he dines at a'&mdash;A drink of
milk and a bit of bread serves his turn, or maybe a cauld potato.&mdash;It's
a heathenish fashion of him, for as good a man as he is, for surely
there is nae Christian man but loves his own bowels.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, that may be,&rdquo; answered Touchwood; &ldquo;but I have known many who took
so much care of their own bowels, my good dame, as to have none for any
one else.&mdash;But come&mdash;bustle to the work&mdash;get us as good a dinner for two
as you can set out&mdash;have it ready at three to an instant&mdash;get the old
hock I had sent me from Cockburn&mdash;a bottle of the particular Indian
Sherry&mdash;and another of your own old claret&mdash;fourth bin, you know,
Meg.&mdash;And stay, he is a priest, and must have port&mdash;have all ready, but
don't bring the wine into the sun, as that silly fool Beck did the other
day.&mdash;I can't go down to the larder myself, but let us have no
blunders.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nae fear, nae fear,&rdquo; said Meg, with a toss of the head, &ldquo;I need naebody
to look into my larder but mysell, I trow&mdash;but it's an unco order of
wine for twa folk, and ane o' them a minister.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, you foolish person, is there not the woman up the village that has
just brought another fool into the world, and will she not need sack and
caudle, if we leave some of our wine?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A gude ale-posset wad set her better,&rdquo; said Meg; &ldquo;however, if it's your
will, it shall be my pleasure.&mdash;But the like of sic a gentleman as
yoursell never entered my doors!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The traveller was gone before she had completed the sentence; and,
leaving Meg to bustle and maunder at<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_245" id="vol_i_Page_245">[Pg&nbsp;245]</a></span> her leisure, away he marched, with
the haste that characterised all his motions when he had any new project
in his head, to form an acquaintance with the minister of St. Ronan's,
whom, while he walks down the street to the Manse, we will endeavour to
introduce to the reader.</p>

<p>The Rev. Josiah Cargill was the son of a small farmer in the south of
Scotland; and a weak constitution, joined to the disposition for study
which frequently accompanies infirm health, induced his parents, though
at the expense of some sacrifices, to educate him for the ministry. They
were the rather led to submit to the privations which were necessary to
support this expense, because they conceived, from their family
traditions, that he had in his veins some portion of the blood of that
celebrated Boanerges of the Covenant, Donald Cargill,<a name="vol_i_FNanchor_G_30" id="vol_i_FNanchor_G_30"></a><a href="#vol_i_Footnote_G_30" class="fnanchor">[G]</a> who was slain
by the persecutors at the town of Queensferry, in the melancholy days of
Charles II., merely because, in the plenitude of his sacerdotal power,
he had cast out of the church, and delivered over to Satan by a formal
excommunication, the King and Royal Family, with all the ministers and
courtiers thereunto belonging. But if Josiah was really derived from
this uncompromising champion, the heat of the family spirit which he
might have inherited was qualified by the sweetness of his own
disposition, and the quiet temper of the times in which he had the good
fortune to live. He was characterised by all who knew him as a mild,
gentle, and studious lover of learning, who, in the quiet prosecution of
his own sole object, the acquisition of knowledge, and especially of
that connected with his profession, had the utmost indulgence for all
whose pursuits were different from his own. His sole relax<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_246" id="vol_i_Page_246">[Pg&nbsp;246]</a></span>ations were
those of a retiring, mild, and pensive temper, and were limited to a
ramble, almost always solitary, among the woods and hills, in praise of
which, he was sometimes guilty of a sonnet, but rather because he could
not help the attempt, than as proposing to himself the fame or the
rewards which attend the successful poet. Indeed, far from seeking to
insinuate his fugitive pieces into magazines and newspapers, he blushed
at his poetical attempts even while alone, and, in fact, was rarely so
indulgent to his vein as to commit them to paper.</p>

<p>From the same maid-like modesty of disposition, our student suppressed a
strong natural turn towards drawing, although he was repeatedly
complimented upon the few sketches which he made, by some whose judgment
was generally admitted. It was, however, this neglected talent, which,
like the swift feet of the stag in the fable, was fated to render him a
service which he might in vain have expected from his worth and
learning.</p>

<p>My Lord Bidmore, a distinguished connoisseur, chanced to be in search of
a private tutor for his son and heir, the Honourable Augustus Bidmore,
and for this purpose had consulted the Professor of Theology, who passed
before him in review several favourite students, any of whom he
conceived well suited for the situation; but still his answer to the
important and unlooked-for question, &ldquo;Did the candidate understand
drawing?&rdquo; was answered in the negative. The Professor, indeed, added his
opinion, that such an accomplishment was neither to be desired nor
expected in a student of theology; but, pressed hard with this condition
as a <i>sine qua non</i>, he at length did remember a dreaming lad abo<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_247" id="vol_i_Page_247">[Pg&nbsp;247]</a></span>ut the
Hall, who seldom could be got to speak above his breath, even when
delivering his essays, but was said to have a strong turn for drawing.
This was enough for my Lord Bidmore, who contrived to obtain a sight of
some of young Cargill's sketches, and was satisfied that, under such a
tutor, his son could not fail to maintain that character for hereditary
taste which his father and grandfather had acquired at the expense of a
considerable estate, the representative value of which was now the
painted canvass in the great gallery at Bidmore-House.</p>

<p>Upon following up the enquiry concerning the young man's character, he
was found to possess all the other necessary qualifications of learning
and morals, in a greater degree than perhaps Lord Bidmore might have
required; and, to the astonishment of his fellow-students, but more
especially to his own, Josiah Cargill was promoted to the desired and
desirable situation of private tutor to the Honourable Mr. Bidmore.</p>

<p>Mr. Cargill did his duty ably and conscientiously, by a spoiled though
good-humoured lad, of weak health and very ordinary parts. He could not,
indeed, inspire into him any portion of the deep and noble enthusiasm
which characterises the youth of genius; but his pupil made such
progress in each branch of his studies as his capacity enabled him to
attain. He understood the learned languages, and could be very profound
on the subject of various readings&mdash;he pursued science, and could class
shells, pack mosses, and arrange minerals&mdash;he drew without taste, but
with much accuracy; and although he attained no commanding height in any
pursuit, he knew enough of many studi<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_248" id="vol_i_Page_248">[Pg&nbsp;248]</a></span>es, literary and scientific, to
fill up his time, and divert from temptation a head, which was none of
the strongest in point of resistance.</p>

<p>Miss Augusta Bidmore, his lordship's only other child, received also the
instructions of Cargill in such branches of science as her father chose
she should acquire, and her tutor was capable to teach. But her progress
was as different from that of her brother, as the fire of heaven differs
from that grosser element which the peasant piles upon his smouldering
hearth. Her acquirements in Italian and Spanish literature, in history,
in drawing, and in all elegant learning, were such as to enchant her
teacher, while at the same time it kept him on the stretch, lest, in her
successful career, the scholar should outstrip the master.</p>

<p>Alas! such intercourse, fraught as it is with dangers arising out of the
best and kindest, as well as the most natural feelings on either side,
proved in the present, as in many other instances, fatal to the peace of
the preceptor. Every feeling heart will excuse a weakness, which we
shall presently find carried with it its own severe punishment. Cadenus,
indeed, believe him who will, has assured us, that, in such a perilous
intercourse, he himself preserved the limits which were unhappily
transgressed by the unfortunate Vanessa, his more impassioned pupil:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;The innocent delight he took<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To see the virgin mind her book,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was but the master's secret joy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In school to hear the finest boy.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But Josiah Cargill was less fortunate, or less cautious. He suffered his
fair pupil to become inexpressibly dear to him, before he discovered the
precip<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_249" id="vol_i_Page_249">[Pg&nbsp;249]</a></span>ice towards which he was moving under the direction of a blind and
misplaced passion. He was indeed utterly incapable of availing himself
of the opportunities afforded by his situation, to involve his pupil in
the toils of a mutual passion. Honour and gratitude alike forbade such a
line of conduct, even had it been consistent with the natural
bashfulness, simplicity, and innocence of his disposition. To sigh and
suffer in secret, to form resolutions of separating himself from a
situation so fraught with danger, and to postpone from day to day the
accomplishment of a resolution so prudent, was all to which the tutor
found himself equal; and it is not improbable, that the veneration with
which he regarded his patron's daughter, with the utter hopelessness of
the passion which he nourished, tended to render his love yet more pure
and disinterested.</p>

<p>At length, the line of conduct which reason had long since recommended,
could no longer be the subject of procrastination. Mr. Bidmore was
destined to foreign travel for a twelvemonth, and Mr. Cargill received
from his patron the alternative of accompanying his pupil, or retiring
upon a suitable provision, the reward of his past instructions. It can
hardly be doubted which he preferred; for while he was with young
Bidmore, he did not seem entirely separated from his sister. He was sure
to hear of Augusta frequently, and to see some part, at least, of the
letters which she was to write to her brother; he might also hope to be
remembered in these letters as her &ldquo;good friend and tutor;&rdquo; and to these
consolations his quiet, contemplative, and yet enthusiastic disposition,
clung as to a secret source of pleasure, the only one which life seemed
to open to him.</p>

<p>But fa<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_250" id="vol_i_Page_250">[Pg&nbsp;250]</a></span>te had a blow in store, which he had not anticipated. The chance
of Augusta's changing her maiden condition for that of a wife, probable
as her rank, beauty, and fortune rendered such an event, had never once
occurred to him; and although he had imposed upon himself the unwavering
belief that she could never be his, he was inexpressibly affected by the
intelligence that she had become the property of another.</p>

<p>The Honourable Mr. Bidmore's letters to his father soon after announced
that poor Mr. Cargill had been seized with a nervous fever, and again,
that his reconvalescence was attended with so much debility, it seemed
both of mind and body, as entirely to destroy his utility as a
travelling companion. Shortly after this the travellers separated, and
Cargill returned to his native country alone, indulging upon the road in
a melancholy abstraction of mind, which he had suffered to grow upon him
since the mental shock which he had sustained, and which in time became
the most characteristical feature of his demeanour. His meditations were
not even disturbed by any anxiety about his future subsistence, although
the cessation of his employment seemed to render that precarious. For
this, however, Lord Bidmore had made provision; for, though a coxcomb
where the fine arts were concerned, he was in other particulars a just
and honourable man, who felt a sincere pride in having drawn the talents
of Cargill from obscurity, and entertained due gratitude for the manner
in which he had achieved the important task intrusted to him in his
family.</p>

<p>His lordship had privately purchased from the Mowbray family the
patronage or advowson of the <span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_251" id="vol_i_Page_251">[Pg&nbsp;251]</a></span>living of St. Ronan's, then held by a very
old incumbent, who died shortly afterwards; so that upon arriving in
England Cargill found himself named to the vacant living. So
indifferent, however, did he feel himself towards this preferment, that
he might possibly not have taken the trouble to go through the necessary
steps previous to his ordination, had it not been on account of his
mother, now a widow, and unprovided for, unless by the support which he
afforded her. He visited her in her small retreat in the suburbs of
Marchthorn, heard her pour out her gratitude to Heaven, that she should
have been granted life long enough to witness her son's promotion to a
charge, which in her eyes was more honourable and desirable than an
Episcopal see&mdash;heard her chalk out the life which they were to lead
together in the humble independence which had thus fallen on him&mdash;he
heard all this, and had no power to crush her hopes and her triumph by
the indulgence of his own romantic feelings. He passed almost
mechanically through the usual forms, and was inducted into the living
of St. Ronan's.</p>

<p>Although fanciful and romantic, it was not in Josiah Cargill's nature to
yield to unavailing melancholy; yet he sought relief, not in society,
but in solitary study. His seclusion was the more complete, that his
mother, whose education had been as much confined as her fortunes, felt
awkward under her new dignities, and willingly acquiesced in her son's
secession from society, and spent her whole time in superintending the
little household, and in her way providing for all emergencies, the
occurrence of which might call Josiah out of his favourite book-room. As
old age rendered her inactive, she began to regret the incapacity of he<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_252" id="vol_i_Page_252">[Pg&nbsp;252]</a></span>r
son to superintend his own household, and talked something of matrimony,
and the mysteries of the muckle wheel. To these admonitions Mr. Cargill
returned only slight and evasive answers; and when the old lady slept in
the village churchyard, at a reverend old age, there was no one to
perform the office of superintendent in the minister's family. Neither
did Josiah Cargill seek for any, but patiently submitted to all the
evils with which a bachelor estate is attended, and which were at least
equal to those which beset the renowned Mago-Pico during his state of
celibacy.<a name="vol_i_FNanchor_22_22" id="vol_i_FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#vol_i_Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> His butter was ill churned, and declared by all but
himself and the quean who made it, altogether uneatable; his milk was
burnt in the pan, his fruit and vegetables were stolen, and his black
stockings mended with blue and white thread.</p>

<p>For all these things the minister cared not, his mind ever bent upon far
different matters. Do not let my fair readers do Josiah more than
justice, or suppose that, like Beltenebros in the desert, he remained
for years the victim of an unfortunate and misplaced passion. No&mdash;to the
shame of the male sex be it spoken, that no degree of hopeless love,
however desperate and sincere, can ever continue for years to embitter
life. There must be hope&mdash;there must be uncertainty&mdash;there must be
reciprocity, to enable the tyrant of the soul to secure a dominion of
very long duration over a manly and well-constituted mind, which is
itself desirous to <i>will</i> its freedom. The memory of Augusta had long
faded from Josiah's thoughts, or was remembered only as a pleasing, but
melancholy and unsubstantial dream, while he was straining forward in
pursuit of a yet nobler and coyer mistress, in a word, of Knowledge
herself.<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_253" id="vol_i_Page_253">[Pg&nbsp;253]</a></span></p>

<p>Every hour that he could spare from his parochial duties, which he
discharged with zeal honourable to his heart and head, was devoted to
his studies, and spent among his books. But this chase of wisdom, though
in itself interesting and dignified, was indulged to an excess which
diminished the respectability, nay, the utility, of the deceived
student; and he forgot, amid the luxury of deep and dark investigations,
that society has its claims, and that the knowledge which is unimparted,
is necessarily a barren talent, and is lost to society, like the miser's
concealed hoard, by the death of the proprietor. His studies were also
under the additional disadvantage, that, being pursued for the
gratification of a desultory longing after knowledge, and directed to no
determined object, they turned on points rather curious than useful, and
while they served for the amusement of the student himself, promised
little utility to mankind at large.</p>

<p>Bewildered amid abstruse researches, metaphysical and historical, Mr.
Cargill, living only for himself and his books, acquired many ludicrous
habits, which exposed the secluded student to the ridicule of the world,
and which tinged, though they did not altogether obscure, the natural
civility of an amiable disposition, as well as the acquired habits of
politeness which he had learned in the good society that frequented Lord
Bidmore's mansion. He not only indulged in neglect of dress and
appearance, and all those ungainly tricks which men are apt to acquire
by living very much alone, but besides, and especially, he became
probably the most abstracted and absent man of a profession peculiarly
li<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_254" id="vol_i_Page_254">[Pg&nbsp;254]</a></span>able to cherish such habits. No man fell so regularly into the painful
dilemma of mistaking, or, in Scottish phrase, <i>miskenning</i>, the person
he spoke to, or more frequently enquired of an old maid for her
husband, of a childless wife about her young people, of the distressed
widower for the spouse at whose funeral he himself had assisted but a
fortnight before; and none was ever more familiar with strangers whom he
had never seen, or seemed more estranged from those who had a title to
think themselves well known to him. The worthy man perpetually
confounded sex, age, and calling; and when a blind beggar extended his
hand for charity, he has been known to return the civility by taking off
his hat, making a low bow, and hoping his worship was well.</p>

<p>Among his brethren, Mr. Cargill alternately commanded respect by the
depth of his erudition, and gave occasion to laughter from his odd
peculiarities. On the latter occasions he used abruptly to withdraw from
the ridicule he had provoked; for notwithstanding the general mildness
of his character, his solitary habits had engendered a testy impatience
of contradiction, and a keener sense of pain arising from the satire of
others, than was natural to his unassuming disposition. As for his
parishioners, they enjoyed, as may reasonably be supposed, many a hearty
laugh at their pastor's expense, and were sometimes, as Mrs. Dods
hinted, more astonished than edified by his learning; for in pursuing a
point of biblical criticism, he did not altogether remember that he was
addressing a popular and unlearned assembly, not delivering a <i>concio ad
clerum</i>&mdash;a mistake, not arising from any conceit of his learning, or
wish to display it, but from <span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_255" id="vol_i_Page_255">[Pg&nbsp;255]</a></span>the same absence of mind which induced an
excellent divine, when preaching before a party of criminals condemned
to death, to break off by promising the wretches, who were to suffer
next morning, &ldquo;the rest of the discourse at the first proper
opportunity.&rdquo; But all the neighbourhood acknowledged Mr. Cargill's
serious and devout discharge of his ministerial duties; and the poorer
parishioners forgave his innocent peculiarities, in consideration of his
unbounded charity; while the heritors, if they ridiculed the
abstractions of Mr. Cargill on some subjects, had the grace to recollect
that they had prevented him from suing an augmentation of stipend,
according to the fashion of the clergy around him, or from demanding at
their hands a new manse, or the repair of the old one. He once, indeed,
wished that they would amend the roof of his book-room, which &ldquo;rained
in&rdquo;<a name="vol_i_FNanchor_23_23" id="vol_i_FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#vol_i_Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> in a very pluvious manner; but receiving no direct answer from
our friend Meiklewham, who neither relished the proposal nor saw means
of eluding it, the minister quietly made the necessary repairs at his
own expense, and gave the heritors no farther trouble on the subject.</p>

<p>Such was the worthy divine whom our <i>bon vivant</i> at the Cleikum Inn
hoped to conciliate by a <span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_256" id="vol_i_Page_256">[Pg&nbsp;256]</a></span>good dinner and Cockburn's particular; an
excellent menstruum in most cases, but not likely to be very efficacious
on the present occasion.</p>

</p>


<p>Our traveller, rapid in all his resolutions and motions, strode stoutly
down the street, and arrived at the Manse, which was, as we have already
described it, all but absolutely ruinous. The total desolation and want
of order about the door, would have argued the place uninhabited, had it
not been for two or three miserable tubs with suds, or such like
sluttish contents, which were left there, that those who broke their
shins among them might receive a sensible proof, that &ldquo;here the hand of
woman had been.&rdquo; The door being half off its hinges, the entrance was
for the time protected by a broken harrow, which must necessarily be
removed before entry could be obtained. The little garden, which might
have given an air of comfort to the old house had it been kept in any
order, was abandoned to a desolation, of which that of the sluggard<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_257" id="vol_i_Page_257">[Pg&nbsp;257]</a></span> was
only a type; and the minister's man, an attendant always proverbial for
doing half work, and who seemed in the present instance to do none, was
seen among docks and nettles, solacing himself with the few gooseberries
which remained on some moss-grown bushes. To him Mr. Touchwood called
loudly, enquiring after his master; but the clown, conscious of being
taken in flagrant delict, as the law says, fled from him like a guilty
thing, instead of obeying his summons, and was soon heard <i>hupping</i> and
<i>geeing</i> to the cart, which he had left on the other side of the broken
wall.</p>

<p>Disappointed in his application to the man-servant, Mr. Touchwood
knocked with his cane, at first gently, then harder, holloaed, bellowed,
and shouted, in the hope of calling the attention of some one within
doors, but received not a word in reply. At length, thinking that no
trespass could be committed upon so forlorn and deserted an
establishment, he removed the obstacles to entrance with such a noise as
he thought must necessarily have alarmed some one, if there was any live
person about the house at all. All was still silent; and, entering a
passage where the damp walls and broken flags corresponded to the
appearance of things out of doors, he opened a door to the left, which,
wonderful to say, still had a latch remaining, and found himself in the
parlour, and in the presence of the person whom he came to visit.</p>

<p>Amid a heap of books and other literary lumber, which had accumulated
around him, sat, in his well-worn leathern elbow chair, the learned
minister of St. Ronan's; a thin, spare man, beyond the middle age, of a
dark complexion, but with eyes which, though now obscured and vacant,
had been once bright, soft<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_258" id="vol_i_Page_258">[Pg&nbsp;258]</a></span>, and expressive, and whose features seemed
interesting, the rather that, notwithstanding the carelessness of his
dress, he was in the habit of performing his ablutions with Eastern
precision; for he had forgot neatness, but not cleanliness. His hair
might have appeared much more disorderly, had it not been thinned by
time, and disposed chiefly around the sides of his countenance and the
back part of his head; black stockings, ungartered, marked his
professional dress, and his feet were thrust into the old slipshod
shoes, which served him instead of slippers. The rest of his garments,
as far as visible, consisted in a plaid nightgown wrapt in long folds
round his stooping and emaciated length of body, and reaching down to
the slippers aforesaid. He was so intently engaged in studying the book
before him, a folio of no ordinary bulk, that he totally disregarded the
noise which Mr. Touchwood made in entering the room, as well as the
coughs and hems with which he thought it proper to announce his
presence.</p>

<p>No notice being taken of these inarticulate signals, Mr. Touchwood,
however great an enemy he was to ceremony, saw the necessity of
introducing his business, as an apology for his intrusion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hem! sir&mdash;Ha, hem!&mdash;You see before you a person in some distress for
want of society, who has taken the liberty to call on you as a good
pastor, who may be, in Christian charity, willing to afford him a little
of your company, since he is tired of his own.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Of this speech Mr. Cargill only understood the words &ldquo;distress&rdquo; and
&ldquo;charity,&rdquo; sounds with which he was well acquainted, and which never
failed to produce some effect on him. He looked at his visitor with<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_259" id="vol_i_Page_259">[Pg&nbsp;259]</a></span>
lack-lustre eye, and, without correcting the first opinion which he had
formed, although the stranger's plump and sturdy frame, as well as his
nicely-brushed coat, glancing cane, and, above all, his upright and
self-satisfied manner, resembled in no respect the dress, form, or
bearing of a mendicant, he quietly thrust a shilling into his hand, and
relapsed into the studious contemplation which the entrance of Touchwood
had interrupted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Upon my word, my good sir,&rdquo; said his visitor, surprised at a degree of
absence of mind which he could hardly have conceived possible, &ldquo;you have
entirely mistaken my object.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sorry my mite is insufficient, my friend,&rdquo; said the clergyman,
without again raising his eyes, &ldquo;it is all I have at present to bestow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you will have the kindness to look up for a moment, my good sir,&rdquo;
said the traveller, &ldquo;you may possibly perceive that you labour under a
considerable mistake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Cargill raised his head, recalled his attention, and, seeing that he
had a well-dressed, respectable-looking person before him, he exclaimed
in much confusion, &ldquo;Ha!&mdash;yes&mdash;on my word, I was so immersed in my
book&mdash;I believe&mdash;I think I have the pleasure to see my worthy friend,
Mr. Lavender?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No such thing, Mr. Cargill,&rdquo; replied Mr Touchwood. &ldquo;I will save you the
trouble of trying to recollect me&mdash;you never saw me before.&mdash;But do not
let me disturb your studies&mdash;I am in no hurry, and my business can wait
your leisure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am much obliged,&rdquo; said Mr. Cargill; &ldquo;have the goodness to take a
chair, if you can find one&mdash;I have a train of thought to recover&mdash;a
slight calculation to finish&mdash;and then I am at your command.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_260" id="vol_i_Page_260">[Pg&nbsp;260]</a></span></p>
<p>The visitor found among the broken furniture, not without difficulty, a
seat strong enough to support his weight, and sat down, resting upon
his cane, and looking attentively at his host, who very soon became
totally insensible of his presence. A long pause of total silence
ensued, only disturbed by the rustling leaves of the folio from which
Mr. Cargill seemed to be making extracts, and now and then by a little
exclamation of surprise and impatience, when he dipped his pen, as
happened once or twice, into his snuff-box, instead of the inkstandish
which stood beside it. At length, just as Mr. Touchwood began to think
the scene as tedious as it was singular, the abstracted student raised
his head, and spoke as if in soliloquy, &ldquo;From Acon, Accor, or St. John
d'Acre, to Jerusalem, how far?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Twenty-three miles north north-west,&rdquo; answered his visitor, without
hesitation.</p>

<p>Mr. Cargill expressed no more surprise at a question which he had put to
himself being answered by the voice of another, than if he had found the
distance on the map, and indeed, was not probably aware of the medium
through which his question had been solved; and it was the tenor of the
answer alone which he attended to in his reply.&mdash;&ldquo;Twenty-three
miles&mdash;Ingulphus,&rdquo; laying his hand on the volume, &ldquo;and Jeffrey Winesauf,
do not agree in this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They may both be d&mdash;&mdash;d, then, for lying block-heads,&rdquo; answered the
traveller.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You might have contradicted their authority, sir, without using such an
expression,&rdquo; said the divine, gravely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cry you mercy, Doctor,&rdquo; said Mr. Touc<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_261" id="vol_i_Page_261">[Pg&nbsp;261]</a></span>hwood; &ldquo;but would you compare
these parchment fellows with me, that have made my legs my compasses
over great part of the inhabited world?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have been in Palestine, then?&rdquo; said Mr. Cargill, drawing himself
upright in his chair, and speaking with eagerness and with interest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may swear that, Doctor, and at Acre too. Why, I was there the month
after Boney had found it too hard a nut to crack.&mdash;I dined with Sir
Sydney's chum, old Djezzar Pacha, and an excellent dinner we had, but
for a dessert of noses and ears brought on after the last remove, which
spoiled my digestion. Old Djezzar thought it so good a joke, that you
hardly saw a man in Acre whose face was not as flat as the palm of my
hand&mdash;Gad, I respect my olfactory organ, and set off the next morning as
fast as the most cursed hard-trotting dromedary that ever fell to poor
pilgrim's lot could contrive to tramp.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you have really been in the Holy Land, sir,&rdquo; said Mr. Cargill, whom
the reckless gaiety of Touchwood's manner rendered somewhat suspicious
of a trick, &ldquo;you will be able materially to enlighten me on the subject
of the Crusades.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They happened before my time, Doctor,&rdquo; replied the traveller.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are to understand that my curiosity refers to the geography of the
countries where these events took place,&rdquo; answered Mr. Cargill.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O! as to that matter, you are lighted on your feet,&rdquo; said Mr.
Touchwood; &ldquo;for the time present I can fit you. Turk, Arab, Copt, and
Druse, I know every one of them, and can make you as well acquainted
with them as myself. Without stirring a step beyond your threshold,<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_262" id="vol_i_Page_262">[Pg&nbsp;262]</a></span> you
shall know Syria as well as I do.&mdash;But one good turn deserves
another&mdash;in that case, you must have the goodness to dine with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I go seldom abroad, sir,&rdquo; said the minister, with a good deal of
hesitation, for his habits of solitude and seclusion could not be
entirely overcome, even by the expectation raised by the traveller's
discourse; &ldquo;yet I cannot deny myself the pleasure of waiting on a
gentleman possessed of so much experience.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well then,&rdquo; said Mr. Touchwood, &ldquo;three be the hour&mdash;I never dine later,
and always to a minute&mdash;and the place, the Cleikum Inn, up the way;
where Mrs. Dods is at this moment busy in making ready such a dinner as
your learning has seldom seen, Doctor, for I brought the receipts from
the four different quarters of the globe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Upon this treaty they parted; and Mr. Cargill, after musing for a short
while upon the singular chance which had sent a living man to answer
those doubts for which he was in vain consulting ancient authorities, at
length resumed, by degrees, the train of reflection and investigation
which Mr. Touchwood's visit had interrupted, and in a short time lost
all recollection of his episodical visitor, and of the engagement which
he had formed.</p>

<p>Not so Mr. Touchwood, who, when not occupied with business of real
importance, had the art, as the reader may have observed, to make a
prodigious fuss about nothing at all. Upon the present occasion, he
bustled in and out of the kitchen, till Mrs. Dods lost patience, and
threatened to pin the dish-clout to his tail; a menace which he
pardoned, in consideration, that in all the countries which he had
visited, which are sufficiently civilized to boast of cooks, th<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_263" id="vol_i_Page_263">[Pg&nbsp;263]</a></span>ese
artists, toiling in their fiery element, have a privilege to be testy
and impatient. He therefore retreated from the torrid region of Mrs.
Dods's microcosm, and employed his time in the usual devices of
loiterers, partly by walking for an appetite, partly by observing the
progress of his watch towards three o'clock, when he had happily
succeeded in getting an employment more serious. His table, in the blue
parlour, was displayed with two covers, after the fairest fashion of the
Cleikum Inn; yet the landlady, with a look &ldquo;civil but sly,&rdquo; contrived to
insinuate a doubt whether the clergyman would come, &ldquo;when a' was dune.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Touchwood scorned to listen to such an insinuation until the fated
hour arrived, and brought with it no Mr. Cargill. The impatient
entertainer allowed five minutes for difference of clocks, and variation
of time, and other five for the procrastination of one who went little
into society. But no sooner were the last five minutes expended, than he
darted off for the Manse, not, indeed, much like a greyhound or a deer,
but with the momentum of a corpulent and well-appetized elderly
gentleman, who is in haste to secure his dinner. He bounced without
ceremony into the parlour, where he found the worthy divine clothed in
the same plaid nightgown, and seated in the very elbow-chair, in which
he had left him five hours before. His sudden entrance recalled to Mr.
Cargill, not an accurate, but something of a general, recollection, of
what had passed in the morning, and he hastened to apologize with
&ldquo;Ha!&mdash;indeed&mdash;already?&mdash;upon my word, Mr. A&mdash;a&mdash;, I mean my dear
friend&mdash;I am afraid I have used you ill&mdash;I forgot to order any
dinner&mdash;but we will do our best.&mdash;Eppie&mdash;Eppie!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Not at the first<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_264" id="vol_i_Page_264">[Pg&nbsp;264]</a></span>, second, nor third call, but <i>ex intervallo</i>, as the
lawyers express it, Eppie, a bare-legged, shock-headed, thick-ankled,
red-armed wench, entered, and announced her presence by an emphatic
&ldquo;What's your wull?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you got any thing in the house for dinner, Eppie?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Naething but bread and milk, plenty o't&mdash;what should I have?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see, sir,&rdquo; said Mr. Cargill, &ldquo;you are like to have a Pythagorean
entertainment; but you are a traveller, and have doubtless been in your
time thankful for bread and milk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But never when there was any thing better to be had,&rdquo; said Mr.
Touchwood. &ldquo;Come, Doctor, I beg your pardon, but your wits are fairly
gone a wool-gathering; it was <i>I</i> invited <i>you</i> to dinner, up at the inn
yonder, and not you me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;On my word, and so it was,&rdquo; said Mr. Cargill; &ldquo;I knew I was quite
right&mdash;I knew there was a dinner engagement betwixt us, I was sure of
that, and that is the main point.&mdash;Come, sir, I wait upon you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you not first change your dress?&rdquo; said the visitor, seeing with
astonishment that the divine proposed to attend him in his plaid
nightgown; &ldquo;why, we shall have all the boys in the village after us&mdash;you
will look like an owl in sunshine, and they will flock round you like so
many hedge-sparrows.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will get my clothes instantly,&rdquo; said the worthy clergyman; &ldquo;I will
get ready directly&mdash;I am really ashamed to keep you waiting, my dear
Mr.&mdash;eh&mdash;eh&mdash;your name has this instant escaped me.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_265" id="vol_i_Page_265">[Pg&nbsp;265]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;It is Touchwood, sir, at your service; I do not believe you ever heard
it before,&rdquo; answered the traveller.</p>

<p>&ldquo;True&mdash;right&mdash;no more I have&mdash;well, my good Mr. Touchstone, will you sit
down an instant until we see what we can do?&mdash;strange slaves we make
ourselves to these bodies of ours, Mr. Touchstone&mdash;the clothing and the
sustaining of them costs us much thought and leisure, which might be
better employed in catering for the wants of our immortal spirits.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Touchwood thought in his heart that never had Bramin or Gymnosophist
less reason to reproach himself with excess in the indulgence of the
table, or of the toilet, than the sage before him; but he assented to
the doctrine, as he would have done to any minor heresy, rather than
protract matters by farther discussing the point at present. In a short
time the minister was dressed in his Sunday's suit, without any farther
mistake than turning one of his black stockings inside out; and Mr.
Touchwood, happy as was Boswell when he carried off Dr. Johnson in
triumph to dine with Strahan and John Wilkes, had the pleasure of
escorting him to the Cleikum Inn.</p>

<p>In the course of the afternoon they became more familiar, and the
familiarity led to their forming a considerable estimate of each other's
powers and acquirements. It is true, the traveller thought the student
too pedantic, too much attached to systems, which, formed in solitude,
he was unwilling to renounce, even when contradicted by the voice and
testimony of experience; and, moreover, considered his utter inattention
to the quality of what he eat and drank, as unworthy of a rational, that
is, of a cooking c<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_266" id="vol_i_Page_266">[Pg&nbsp;266]</a></span>reature, or of a being who, as defined by Johnson,
holds his dinner as the most important business of the day. Cargill did
not act up to this definition, and was, therefore, in the eyes of his
new acquaintance, so far ignorant and uncivilized. What then? He was
still a sensible, intelligent man, however abstemious and bookish.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the divine could not help regarding his new friend as
something of an epicure or belly-god, nor could he observe in him either
the perfect education, or the polished bearing, which mark the gentleman
of rank, and of which, while he mingled with the world, he had become a
competent judge. Neither did it escape him, that in the catalogue of Mr.
Touchwood's defects, occurred that of many travellers, a slight
disposition to exaggerate his own personal adventures, and to prose
concerning his own exploits. But then, his acquaintance with Eastern
manners, existing now in the same state in which they were found during
the time of the Crusades, formed a living commentary on the works of
William of Tyre, Raymund of Saint Giles, the Moslem annals of
Abulfaragi, and other historians of the dark period, with which his
studies were at present occupied.</p>

<p>A friendship, a companionship at least, was therefore struck up hastily
betwixt these two originals; and to the astonishment of the whole parish
of St. Ronan's, the minister thereof was seen once more leagued and
united with an individual of his species, generally called among them
the Cleikum Nabob. Their intercourse sometimes consisted in long walks,
which they took in company, traversing, however, as limited a space of
ground, as if it had been actually roped in for their pedestrian
exercise. Their parade <span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_267" id="vol_i_Page_267">[Pg&nbsp;267]</a></span>was, according to circumstances, a low haugh at
the nether end of the ruinous hamlet, or the esplanade in the front of
the old castle; and, in either case, the direct longitude of their
promenade never exceeded a hundred yards. Sometimes, but rarely, the
divine took share of Mr. Touchwood's meal, though less splendidly set
forth than when he was first invited to partake of it; for, like the
owner of the gold cup in Parnell's Hermit, when cured of his
ostentation,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&mdash;&mdash;&ldquo;Still he welcomed, but with less of cost.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>On these occasions, the conversation was not of the regular and
compacted nature, which passes betwixt men, as they are ordinarily
termed, of this world. On the contrary, the one party was often thinking
of Saladin and C&oelig;ur de Lion, when the other was haranguing on Hyder
Ali and Sir Eyre Coote. Still, however, the one spoke, and the other
seemed to listen; and, perhaps, the lighter intercourse of society,
where amusement is the sole object, can scarcely rest on a safer and
more secure basis.</p>

<p>It was on one of the evenings when the learned divine had taken his
place at Mr. Touchwood's social board, or rather at Mrs. Dods's,&mdash;for a
cup of excellent tea, the only luxury which Mr. Cargill continued to
partake of with some complacence, was the regale before them,&mdash;that a
card was delivered to the Nabob.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;Mr. and Miss Mowbray see company at Shaws-Castle on the twentieth
current, at two o'clock&mdash;a <i>d&eacute;je&ucirc;ner</i>&mdash;dresses in character

<p>&ldquo;See company? the more fools they,<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_268" id="vol_i_Page_268">[Pg&nbsp;268]</a></span>&rdquo; he continued by way of comment. &ldquo;See
company?&mdash;choice phrases are ever commendable&mdash;and this piece of
pasteboard is to intimate that one may go and meet all the fools of the
parish, if they have a mind&mdash;in my time they asked the honour, or the
pleasure, of a stranger's company. I suppose, by and by, we shall have
in this country the ceremonial of a Bedouin's tent, where every ragged
Hadgi, with his green turban, comes in slap without leave asked, and has
his black paw among the rice, with no other apology than Salam
Alicum.&mdash;&lsquo;Dresses in character&mdash;Dramatic picture&rsquo;&mdash;what new tomfoolery
can that be?&mdash;but it does not signify.&mdash;Doctor! I say Doctor!&mdash;but he is
in the seventh heaven&mdash;I say, Mother Dods, you who know all the news&mdash;Is
this the feast that was put off until Miss Mowbray should be better?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Troth is it, Maister Touchwood&mdash;they are no in the way of giving twa
entertainments in one season&mdash;no very wise to gie ane maybe&mdash;but they
ken best.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say, Doctor, Doctor!&mdash;Bless his five wits, he is charging the
Moslemah with stout King Richard&mdash;I say, Doctor, do you know any thing
of these Mowbrays?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing extremely particular,&rdquo; answered Mr. Cargill, after a pause; &ldquo;it
is an ordinary tale of greatness, which blazes in one century, and is
extinguished in the next. I think Camden says, that Thomas Mowbray, who
was Grand-Marshal of England, succeeded to that high office, as well as
to the Dukedom of Norfolk, as grandson of Roger Bigot, in 1301.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pshaw, man, you are back into the 14th century&mdash;I mean these Mowbrays
of St. Ro<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_269" id="vol_i_Page_269">[Pg&nbsp;269]</a></span>nan's&mdash;now, don't fall asleep again until you have answered my
question&mdash;and don't look so like a startled hare&mdash;I am speaking no
treason.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The clergyman floundered a moment, as is usual with an absent man who is
recovering the train of his ideas, or a somnambulist when he is suddenly
awakened, and then answered, still with hesitation,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mowbray of St. Ronan's?&mdash;ha&mdash;eh&mdash;I know&mdash;that is&mdash;I did know the
family.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here they are going to give a masquerade, a <i>bal par&eacute;</i>, private
theatricals, I think, and what not,&rdquo; handing him the card.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I saw something of this a fortnight ago,&rdquo; said Mr. Cargill; &ldquo;indeed, I
either had a ticket myself, or I saw such a one as that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you sure you did not attend the party, Doctor?&rdquo; said the Nabob.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who attend? I? you are jesting, Mr. Touchwood.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But are you quite positive?&rdquo; demanded Mr. Touchwood, who had observed,
to his infinite amusement, that the learned and abstracted scholar was
so conscious of his own peculiarities, as never to be very sure on any
such subject.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Positive!&rdquo; he repeated with embarrassment; &ldquo;my memory is so wretched
that I never like to be positive&mdash;but had I done any thing so far out of
my usual way, I must have remembered it, one would think&mdash;and&mdash;I <i>am</i>
positive I was not there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Neither could you, Doctor,&rdquo; said the Nabob, laughing at the process by
which his friend reasoned himself into confidence, &ldquo;for it did not take
place&mdash;it was adjourned, and this is the seco<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_270" id="vol_i_Page_270">[Pg&nbsp;270]</a></span>nd invitation&mdash;there will
be one for you, as you had a card to the former.&mdash;Come, Doctor, you must
go&mdash;you and I will go together&mdash;I as an Imaum&mdash;I can say my Bismillah
with any Hadgi of them all&mdash;You as a cardinal, or what you like best.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who, I?&mdash;it is unbecoming my station, Mr. Touchwood,&rdquo; said the
clergyman&mdash;&ldquo;a folly altogether inconsistent with my habits.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All the better&mdash;you shall change your habits.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You had better gang up and see them, Mr. Cargill,&rdquo; said Mrs. Dods; &ldquo;for
it's maybe the last sight ye may see of Miss Mowbray&mdash;they say she is to
be married and off to England ane of thae odd-come-shortlies, wi' some
of the gowks about the Waal down-by.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Married!&rdquo; said the clergyman; &ldquo;it is impossible!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But where's the impossibility, Mr. Cargill, when ye see folk marry
every day, and buckle them yoursell into the bargain?&mdash;Maybe ye think
the puir lassie has a bee in her bannet; but ye ken yoursell if naebody
but wise folk were to marry, the warld wad be ill peopled. I think it's
the wise folk that keep single, like yoursell and me, Mr. Cargill.&mdash;Gude
guide us!&mdash;are ye weel?&mdash;will ye taste a drap o' something?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sniff at my ottar of roses,&rdquo; said Mr. Touchwood; &ldquo;the scent would
revive the dead&mdash;why, what in the devil's name is the meaning of
this?&mdash;you were quite well just now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A sudden qualm,&rdquo; said Mr. Cargill, recovering himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! Mr. Cargill,&rdquo; said Dame Dods, &ldquo;this comes of your lang fasts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;R<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_271" id="vol_i_Page_271">[Pg&nbsp;271]</a></span>ight, dame,&rdquo; subjoined Mr. Touchwood; &ldquo;and of breaking them with sour
milk and pease bannock&mdash;the least morsel of Christian food is rejected
by stomach, just as a small gentleman refuses the visit of a creditable
neighbour, lest he see the nakedness of the land&mdash;ha! ha!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And there is really a talk of Miss Mowbray of St Ronan's being
married?&rdquo; said the clergyman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Troth is there,&rdquo; said the dame; &ldquo;it's Trotting Nelly's news; and though
she likes a drappie, I dinna think she would invent a lee or carry
ane&mdash;at least to me, that am a gude customer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This must be looked to,&rdquo; said Mr. Cargill, as if speaking to himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In troth, and so it should,&rdquo; said Dame Dods; &ldquo;it's a sin and a shame if
they should employ the tinkling cymbal they ca' Chatterly, and sic a
Presbyterian trumpet as yoursell in the land, Mr. Cargill; and if ye
will take a fule's advice, ye winna let the multure be ta'en by your ain
mill, Mr. Cargill.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;True, true, good Mother Dods,&rdquo; said the Nabob; &ldquo;gloves and hatbands are
things to be looked after, and Mr. Cargill had better go down to this
cursed festivity with me, in order to see after his own interest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must speak with the young lady,&rdquo; said the clergyman, still in a brown
study.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Right, right, my boy of black-letter,&rdquo; said the Nabob; &ldquo;with me you
shall go, and we'll bring them to submission to mother-church, I warrant
you&mdash;Why, the idea of being cheated in such a way, would scare a Santon
out of his trance.&mdash;What dress will you wear?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My own, to be sure,&rdquo; said the divine, starting from his reverie.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_272" id="vol_i_Page_272">[Pg&nbsp;272]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;True, thou art right again&mdash;they may want to knit the knot on the spot,
and who would be married by a parson in masquerade?&mdash;We go to the
entertainment though&mdash;it is a done thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The clergyman assented, p<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_273" id="vol_i_Page_273">[Pg&nbsp;273]</a></span>rovided he should receive an invitation; and as
that was found at the Manse, he had no excuse for retracting, even if he
had seemed to desire one.</p>

<h3>FORTUNE'S FROLICS.</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Count Basset.</i> We gentlemen, whose carriages run on the four aces,

<p class="citation">
<i>The Provoked Husband.</i><br />
</p>


<p>Our history must now look a little backwards; and although it is rather
foreign to our natural style of composition, it must speak more in
narrative, and less in dialogue, rather telling what happened, than its
effects upon the actors. Our purpose, however, is only conditional, for
we foresee temptations which may render it difficult for us exactly to
keep it.</p>

<p>The arrival of the young Earl of Etherington at the salutiferous
fountain of St. Ronan's had produced the strongest sensation;
especially, as it was joined with the singular accident of the attempt
upon his lordship's person, as he took a short cut through the woods on
foot, at a distance from his equipage and servants. The gallantry with
which he beat off the highwayman, was only equal to his generosity; for
he declined making any researches after the poor devil, although his
lordship had received a severe wound in the scuffle.</p>

<p>Of<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_274" id="vol_i_Page_274">[Pg&nbsp;274]</a></span> the &ldquo;three black Graces,&rdquo; as they have been termed by one of the most
pleasant companions of our time, Law and Physic hastened to do homage
to Lord Etherington, represented by Mr. Meiklewham and Dr. Quackleben;
while Divinity, as favourable, though more coy, in the person of the
Reverend Mr. Simon Chatterly, stood on tiptoe to offer any service in
her power.</p>

<p>For the honourable reason already assigned, his lordship, after thanking
Mr. Meiklewham, and hinting, that he might have different occasion for
his services, declined his offer to search out the delinquent by whom he
had been wounded; while to the care of the Doctor he subjected the cure
of a smart flesh-wound in the arm, together with a slight scratch on the
temple; and so very genteel was his behaviour on the occasion, that the
Doctor, in his anxiety for his safety, enjoined him a month's course of
the waters, if he would enjoy the comfort of a complete and perfect
recovery. Nothing so frequent, he could assure his lordship, as the
opening of cicatrized wounds; and the waters of St. Ronan's spring
being, according to Dr. Quackleben, a remedy for all the troubles which
flesh is heir to, could not fail to equal those of Barege, in
facilitating the discharge of all splinters or extraneous matter, which
a bullet may chance to incorporate with the human frame, to its great
annoyance. For he was wont to say, that although he could not declare
the waters which he patronised to be an absolute <i>panpharmacon</i>, yet he
would with word and pen maintain, that they possessed the principal
virtues of the most celebrated medicinal springs in the known world. In
short, the love of Alpheus for Arethusa was a mere jest, compared to
that which the Doctor entertained for his favourite fountain.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_275" id="vol_i_Page_275">[Pg&nbsp;275]</a></span></p>
<p>The new and noble guest, whose arrival so much illustrated these scenes
of convalescence and of gaiety, was not at first seen so much at the
ordinary, and other places of public resort, as had been the hope of the
worthy company assembled. His health and his wound proved an excuse for
making his visits to the society few and far between.</p>

<p>But when he did appear, his manners and person were infinitely
captivating; and even the carnation-coloured silk handkerchief, which
suspended his wounded arm, together with the paleness and languor which
loss of blood had left on his handsome and open countenance, gave a
grace to the whole person which many of the ladies declared
irresistible. All contended for his notice, attracted at once by his
affability, and piqued by the calm and easy nonchalance with which it
seemed to be blended. The scheming and selfish Mowbray, the
coarse-minded and brutal Sir Bingo, accustomed to consider themselves,
and to be considered, as the first men of the party, sunk into
comparative insignificance. But chiefly Lady Penelope threw out the
captivations of her wit and her literature; while Lady Binks, trusting
to her natural charms, endeavoured equally to attract his notice. The
other nymphs of the Spa held a little back, upon the principle of that
politeness, which, at continental hunting parties, affords the first
shot at a fine piece of game, to the person of the highest rank present;
but the thought throbbed in many a fair bosom, that their ladyships
might miss their aim, in spite of the advantages thus allowed them, and
that there might then be room for less exalted, but perhaps not less
skilful, markswomen, to try their chance.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_276" id="vol_i_Page_276">[Pg&nbsp;276]</a></span></p>
<p>But while the Earl thus withdrew from public society, it was necessary,
at least natural, that he should choose some one with whom to share the
solitude of his own apartment; and Mowbray, superior in rank to the
half-pay whisky-drinking Captain MacTurk; in dash to Winterblossom, who
was broken down, and turned twaddler; and in tact and sense to Sir Bingo
Binks, easily man&oelig;uvred himself into his lordship's more intimate
society; and internally thanking the honest footpad, whose bullet had
been the indirect means of secluding his intended victim from all
society but his own, he gradually began to feel the way, and prove the
strength of his antagonist, at the various games of skill and hazard
which he introduced, apparently with the sole purpose of relieving the
tedium of a sick-chamber.</p>

<p>Meiklewham, who felt, or affected, the greatest possible interest in his
patron's success, and who watched every opportunity to enquire how his
schemes advanced, received at first such favourable accounts as made him
grin from ear to ear, rub his hands, and chuckle forth such bursts of
glee as only the success of triumphant roguery could have extorted from
him. Mowbray looked grave, however, and checked his mirth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There was something in it after all,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that he could not
perfectly understand. Etherington, an used hand&mdash;d&mdash;&mdash;d sharp&mdash;up to
every thing, and yet he lost his money like a baby.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what the matter how he loses it, so you win it like a man?&rdquo; said
his legal friend and adviser.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, hang it, I cannot tell,&rdquo; replied Mowbray&mdash;&ldquo;were it not that I
think he has scarce the impudenc<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_277" id="vol_i_Page_277">[Pg&nbsp;277]</a></span>e to propose such a thing to succeed,
curse me but I should think he was coming the old soldier over me, and
keeping up his game.&mdash;But no&mdash;he can scarce have the impudence to think
of that.&mdash;I find, however, that he has done Wolverine&mdash;cleaned out poor
Tom&mdash;though Tom wrote to me the precise contrary, yet the truth has
since come out&mdash;Well, I shall avenge him, for I see his lordship is to
be had as well as other folk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Weel, Mr. Mowbray,&rdquo; said the lawyer, in a tone of affected sympathy,
&ldquo;ye ken your own ways best&mdash;but the heavens will bless a moderate mind.
I would not like to see you ruin this poor lad, <i>funditus</i>, that is to
say, out and out. To lose some of the ready will do him no great harm,
and maybe give him a lesson he may be the better of as long as he
lives&mdash;but I wad not, as an honest man, wish you to go deeper&mdash;you
should spare the lad, Mr. Mowbray.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who spared <i>me</i>, Meiklewham?&rdquo; said Mowbray, with a look and tone of
deep emphasis&mdash;&ldquo;No, no&mdash;he must go through the mill&mdash;money and money's
worth.&mdash;His seat is called Oakendale&mdash;think of that, Mick&mdash;Oakendale!
Oh, name of thrice happy augury!&mdash;Speak not of mercy, Mick&mdash;the
squirrels of Oakendale must be dismounted, and learn to go a-foot.&mdash;What
mercy can the wandering lord of Troy expect among the Greeks?&mdash;The
Greeks!&mdash;I am a very Suliote&mdash;the bravest of Greeks.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&lsquo;I think not of pity, I think not of fear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He neither must know who would serve the Vizier.&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And necessity, Mick,&rdquo; he concluded, with a tone something altered,
&ldquo;necessity is as unrelenting a leader as any Vizier or Pacha, whom
Scanderbeg ever fought with, or Byron has <span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_278" id="vol_i_Page_278">[Pg&nbsp;278]</a></span>sung.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Meiklewham echoed his patron's ejaculation with a sound betwixt a
whine, a chuckle, and a groan; the first being designed to express his
pretended pity for the destined victim; the second his sympathy with his
patron's prospects of success; and the third being a whistle admonitory
of the dangerous courses through which his object was to be pursued.</p>

<p>Suliote as he boasted himself, Mowbray had, soon after this
conversation, some reason to admit that,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;When Greek meets Greek, then comes the tug of war.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The light skirmishing betwixt the parties was ended, and the serious
battle commenced with some caution on either side; each perhaps,
desirous of being master of his opponent's system of tactics, before
exposing his own. Piquet, the most beautiful game at which a man can
make sacrifice of his fortune, was one with which Mowbray had, for his
misfortune perhaps, been accounted, from an early age, a great
proficient, and in which the Earl of Etherington, with less experience,
proved no novice. They now played for such stakes as Mowbray's state of
fortune rendered considerable to him, though his antagonist appeared not
to regard the amount. And they played with various success; for, though
Mowbray at times returned with a smile of confidence the enquiring looks
of his friend Meiklewham, there were other occasions on which he seemed
to evade them, as if his own had a sad confession to make in reply.</p>

<p>These alternations, though frequent, did no<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_279" id="vol_i_Page_279">[Pg&nbsp;279]</a></span>t occupy, after all, many
days; for Mowbray, a friend of all hours, spent much of his time in Lord
Etherington's apartment, and these few days were days of battle. In the
meantime, as his lordship was now sufficiently recovered to join the
Party at Shaws-Castle, and Miss Mowbray's health being announced as
restored, that proposal was renewed, with the addition of a dramatic
entertainment, the nature of which we shall afterwards have occasion to
explain. Cards were anew issued to all those who had been formerly
included in the invitation, and of course to Mr. Touchwood, as formerly
a resident at the Well, and now in the neighbourhood; it being
previously agreed among the ladies, that a Nabob, though sometimes a
dingy or damaged commodity, was not to be rashly or unnecessarily
neglected. As to the parson, he had been asked, of course, as an old
acquaintance of the Mowbray house, not to be left out when the friends
of the family were invited on a great scale; but his habits were well
known, and it was no more expected that he would leave his manse on such
an occasion, than that the kirk should loosen itself from its
foundations.</p>

<p>It was after these arrangements had been made, that the Laird of St.
Ronan's suddenly entered Meiklewham's private apartment with looks of
exultation. The worthy scribe turned his spectacled nose towards his
patron, and holding in one hand the bunch of papers which he had been
just perusing, and in the other the tape with which he was about to tie
them up again, suspended that operation to await with open eyes and ears
the communication of Mowbray.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have done him!&rdquo; he said, exultingly, y<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_280" id="vol_i_Page_280">[Pg&nbsp;280]</a></span>et in a tone of voice lowered
almost to a whisper; &ldquo;capotted his lordship for this bout&mdash;doubled my
capital, Mick, and something more.&mdash;Hush, don't interrupt me&mdash;we must
think of Clara now&mdash;she must share the sunshine, should it prove but a
blink before a storm.&mdash;You know, Mick, these two d&mdash;&mdash;d women, Lady
Penelope and the Binks, have settled that they will have something like
a <i>bal par&eacute;</i> on this occasion, a sort of theatrical exhibition, and that
those who like it shall be dressed in character.&mdash;I know their
meaning&mdash;they think Clara has no dress fit for such foolery, and so they
hope to eclipse her; Lady Pen, with her old-fashioned, ill-set diamonds,
and my Lady Binks, with the new-fashioned finery which she swopt her
character for. But Clara shan't borne down so, by &mdash;&mdash;! I got that
affected slut, Lady Binks's maid, to tell me what her mistress had set
her mind on, and she is to wear a Grecian habit, forsooth, like one of
Will Allan's Eastern subjects.&mdash;But here's the rub&mdash;there is only one
shawl for sale in Edinburgh that is worth showing off in, and that is at
the Gallery of Fashion.&mdash;Now, Mick, my friend, that shawl must be had
for Clara, with the other trankums of muslin and lace, and so forth,
which you will find marked in the paper there.&mdash;Send instantly and
secure it, for, as Lady Binks writes by to-morrow's post, your order can
go by to-night's mail&mdash;There is a note for L.100.&rdquo;</p>

<p>From a mechanical habit of never refusing any thing, Meiklewham readily
took the note, but having looked at it through his spectacles, he
continued to hold it in his hand as he remonstrated with his
patron.&mdash;&ldquo;This is a' very <span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_281" id="vol_i_Page_281">[Pg&nbsp;281]</a></span>kindly meant, St. Ronan's&mdash;very kindly meant;
and I wad be the last to say that Miss Clara does not merit respect and
kindness at your hand; but I doubt mickle if she wad care a bodle for
thae braw things. Ye ken yoursell, she seldom alters her fashions. Od,
she thinks her riding-habit dress eneugh for ony company; and if you
were ganging by good looks, so it is&mdash;if she had a thought mair colour,
poor dear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; said Mowbray, impatiently, &ldquo;let me alone to reconcile a
woman and a fine dress.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To be sure, ye ken best,&rdquo; said the writer; &ldquo;but, after a', now, wad it
no be better to lay by this hundred pound in Tam Turnpenny's, in case
the young lady should want it afterhend, just for a sair foot?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are a fool, Mick; what signifies healing a sore foot, when there
will be a broken heart in the case?&mdash;No, no&mdash;get the things as I desire
you&mdash;we will blaze them down for one day at least; perhaps it will be
the beginning of a proper dash.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Weel, weel, I wish it may be so,&rdquo; answered Meiklewham; &ldquo;but this young
Earl&mdash;hae ye found the weak point?&mdash;Can ye get a decerniture against
him, with expenses?&mdash;that is the question.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish I could answer it,&rdquo; said Mowbray, thoughtfully.&mdash;&ldquo;Confound the
fellow&mdash;he is a cut above me in rank and in society too&mdash;belongs to the
great clubs, and is in with the Superlatives and Inaccessibles, and all
that sort of folk.&mdash;My training has been a peg lower&mdash;but, hang it,
there are better dogs bred in the kennel than in the parlour. I am up to
him, I think&mdash;at least I will soon know, Mick, whether I am or no, and
that is always one comfort. Never mind&mdash;do you execute my commission,
and take care you name no names&mdash;I must save my little Abigail's
reputation.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_282" id="vol_i_Page_282">[Pg&nbsp;282]</a></span></p>

<p>They parted, Meiklewham to execute his patron's commission&mdash;his patron
to bring to the test those hopes, the uncertainty of which he could not
disguise from his own sagacity.</p>

<p>Trusting to the continuance of his run of luck, Mowbray resolved to
bring affairs to a crisis that same evening. Every thing seemed in the
outset to favour his purpose. They had dined together in Lord
Etherington's apartments&mdash;his state of health interfered with the
circulation of the bottle, and a drizzly autumnal evening rendered
walking disagreeable, even had they gone no farther than the private
stable where Lord Etherington's horses were kept, under the care of a
groom of superior skill. Cards were naturally, almost necessarily,
resorted to, as the only alternative for helping away the evening, and
piquet was, as formerly, chosen for the game.</p>

<p>Lord Etherington seemed at first indolently careless and indifferent
about his play, suffering advantages to escape him, of which, in a more
attentive state of mind, he could not have failed to avail himself.
Mowbray upbraided him with his inattention, and proposed a deeper stake,
in order to interest him in the game. The young nobleman complied; and
in the course of a few hands, the gamesters became both deeply engaged
in watching and profiting by the changes of fortune. These were so many,
so varied, and so unexpected, that the very souls of the players seemed
at length centred in the event of the struggle; and, by dint of doubling
stakes, the accumulated sum of a thousand pounds and upwards, upon each
side, came to be staked in the issue <span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_283" id="vol_i_Page_283">[Pg&nbsp;283]</a></span>of the game.&mdash;So large a risk
included all those funds which Mowbray commanded by his sister's
kindness, and nearly all his previous winnings, so to him the
alternative was victory or ruin. He could not hide his agitation,
however desirous to do so. He drank wine to supply himself with
courage&mdash;he drank water to cool his agitation; and at length bent
himself to play with as much care and attention as he felt himself
enabled to command.</p>

<p>In the first part of the game their luck appeared tolerably equal, and
the play of both befitting gamesters who had dared to place such a sum
on the cast. But, as it drew towards a conclusion, fortune altogether
deserted him who stood most in need of her favour, and Mowbray, with
silent despair, saw his fate depend on a single trick, and that with
every odds against him, for Lord Etherington was elder hand. But how can
fortune's favour secure any one who is not true to himself?&mdash;By an
infraction of the laws of the game, which could only have been expected
from the veriest bungler that ever touched a card, Lord Etherington
called a point without showing it, and, by the ordinary rule, Mowbray
was entitled to count his own&mdash;and in the course of that and the next
hand, gained the game and swept the stakes. Lord Etherington showed
chagrin and displeasure, and seemed to think that the rigour of the game
had been more insisted upon than in courtesy it ought to have been, when
men were playing for so small a stake. Mowbray did not understand this
logic. A thousand pounds, he said, were in his eyes no nutshells; the
rules of piquet were insisted on by all but boys and women; and for his
part, he had rather not play at all than not play the game.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_284" id="vol_i_Page_284">[Pg&nbsp;284]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;So it would seem, my dear Mowbray,&rdquo; said the Earl; &ldquo;for on my soul, I
never saw so disconsolate a visage as thine during that unlucky
game&mdash;it withdrew all my attention from my hand; and I may safely say,
your rueful countenance has stood me in a thousand pounds. If I could
transfer thy long visage to canvass, I should have both my revenge and
my money; for a correct resemblance would be worth not a penny less than
the original has cost me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are welcome to your jest, my lord,&rdquo; said Mowbray, &ldquo;it has been well
paid for; and I will serve you in ten thousand at the same rate. What
say you?&rdquo; he proceeded, taking up and shuffling the cards, &ldquo;will you do
yourself more justice in another game?&mdash;Revenge, they say, is sweet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have no appetite for it this evening,&rdquo; said the Earl, gravely; &ldquo;if I
had, Mowbray, you might come by the worse. I do not <i>always</i> call a
point without showing it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your lordship is out of humour with yourself for a blunder that might
happen to any man&mdash;it was as much my good luck as a good hand would have
been, and so fortune be praised.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what if with this Fortune had nought to do?&rdquo; replied Lord
Etherington.&mdash;&ldquo;What if, sitting down with an honest fellow and a friend
like yourself, Mowbray, a man should rather choose to lose his own
money, which he could afford, than to win what it might distress his
friend to part with?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Supposing a case so far out of supposition, my lord,&rdquo; answered Mowbray,
who felt the question ticklish&mdash;&ldquo;for, with submission, the allegation is
easily made, and is totally incapable of proof<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_285" id="vol_i_Page_285">[Pg&nbsp;285]</a></span>&mdash;I should say, no one had
a right to think for me in such a particular, or to suppose that I
played for a higher stake than was convenient.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And thus your friend, poor devil,&rdquo; replied Lord Etherington, &ldquo;would
lose his money, and run the risk of a quarrel into the boot!&mdash;We will
try it another way&mdash;Suppose this good-humoured and simple-minded
gamester had a favour of the deepest import to ask of his friend, and
judged it better to prefer his request to a winner than to a loser?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If this applies to me, my lord,&rdquo; replied Mowbray, &ldquo;it is necessary I
should learn how I can oblige your lordship.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is a word soon spoken, but so difficult to be recalled, that I am
almost tempted to pause&mdash;but yet it must be said.&mdash;Mowbray, you have a
sister.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mowbray started.&mdash;&ldquo;I have indeed a sister, my lord; but I can conceive
no case in which her name can enter with propriety into our present
discussion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Again in the menacing mood!&rdquo; said Lord Etherington, in his former tone;
&ldquo;now, here is a pretty fellow&mdash;he would first cut my throat for having
won a thousand pounds from me, and then for offering to make his sister
a countess!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A countess, my lord?&rdquo; said Mowbray; &ldquo;you are but jesting&mdash;you have
never even seen Clara Mowbray.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps not&mdash;but what then?&mdash;I may have seen her picture, as Puff says
in the Critic, or fallen in love with her from rumour&mdash;or, to save
farther suppositions, as I see they render you impatient, I may be
satisfied with knowing that she is a beautiful and accomplished young
lady, with a large fortune.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_286" id="vol_i_Page_286">[Pg&nbsp;286]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;What fortune do you mean, my lord?&rdquo; said Mowbray, recollecting with
alarm some claims, which, according to Meiklewham's view of the
subject, his sister might form upon his property.&mdash;&ldquo;What estate?&mdash;there
is nothing belongs to our family, save these lands of St. Ronan's, or
what is left of them; and of these I am, my lord, an undoubted heir of
entail in possession.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be it so,&rdquo; said the Earl, &ldquo;for I have no claim on your mountain realms
here, which are, doubtless,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&mdash;&mdash;&lsquo;renown'd of old<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For knights, and squires, and barons bold;&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>my views respect a much richer, though less romantic domain&mdash;a large
manor, hight Nettlewood. House old, but standing in the midst of such
glorious oaks&mdash;three thousand acres of land, arable, pasture, and
woodland, exclusive of the two closes, occupied by Widow Hodge and
Goodman Trampclod&mdash;manorial rights&mdash;mines and minerals&mdash;and the devil
knows how many good things besides, all lying in the vale of Bever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what has my sister to do with all this?&rdquo; asked Mowbray, in great
surprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing; but that it belongs to her when she becomes Countess of
Etherington.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is, then, your lordship's property already?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, by Jove! nor can it, unless your sister honours me with her
approbation of my suit,&rdquo; replied the Earl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is a sorer puzzle than one of Lady Penelope's charades, my lord,&rdquo;
said Mr. Mowbray; &ldquo;I must call in the assistance of the Reverend Mr.
Chatterly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You shall not need,&rdquo; said Lord Etherington; &ldquo;I wi<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_287" id="vol_i_Page_287">[Pg&nbsp;287]</a></span>ll give you the key,
but listen to me with patience.&mdash;You know that we nobles of England,
less jealous of our sixteen quarters than those on the continent, do
not take scorn to line our decayed ermines with the little cloth of gold
from the city; and my grandfather was lucky enough to get a wealthy
wife, with a halting pedigree,&mdash;rather a singular circumstance,
considering that her father was a countryman of yours. She had a
brother, however, still more wealthy than herself, and who increased his
fortune by continuing to carry on the trade which had first enriched his
family. At length he summed up his books, washed his hands of commerce,
and retired to Nettlewood, to become a gentleman; and here my much
respected grand-uncle was seized with the rage of making himself a man
of consequence. He tried what marrying a woman of family would do; but
he soon found that whatever advantage his family might derive from his
doing so, his own condition was but little illustrated. He next resolved
to become a man of family himself. His father had left Scotland when
very young, and bore, I blush to say, the vulgar name of Scrogie. This
hapless dissyllable my uncle carried in person to the herald office in
Scotland; but neither Lyon, nor Marchmont, nor Islay, nor Snadoun,
neither herald nor pursuivant, would patronise Scrogie.&mdash;Scrogie!&mdash;there
could nothing be made out of it&mdash;so that my worthy relative had recourse
to the surer side of the house, and began to found his dignity on his
mother's name of Mowbray. In this he was much more successful, and I
believe some sly fellow stole for him a slip from your own family tree,
Mr. Mowbray of St. Ronan's, which, I daresay, you have never missed. At
any rate, for his <i>argent</i> <span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_288" id="vol_i_Page_288">[Pg&nbsp;288]</a></span>and <i>or</i>, he got a handsome piece of
parchment, blazoned with a white lion for Mowbray, to be borne
quarterly, with three stunted or scrog-bushes for Scrogie, and became
thenceforth Mr. Scrogie Mowbray, or rather, as he subscribed himself,
Reginald (his former Christian name was Ronald) S. Mowbray. He had a son
who most undutifully laughed at all this, refused the honours of the
high name of Mowbray, and insisted on retaining his father's original
appellative of Scrogie, to the great annoyance of his said father's
ears, and damage of his temper.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, faith, betwixt the two,&rdquo; said Mowbray, &ldquo;I own I should have
preferred my own name, and I think the old gentleman's taste rather
better than the young one's.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;True; but both were wilful, absurd originals, with a happy obstinacy of
temper, whether derived from Mowbray or Scrogie I know not, but which
led them so often into opposition, that the offended father, Reginald S.
Mowbray, turned his recusant son Scrogie fairly out of doors; and the
fellow would have paid for his plebeian spirit with a vengeance, had he
not found refuge with a surviving partner of the original Scrogie of
all, who still carried on the lucrative branch of traffic by which the
family had been first enriched. I mention these particulars to account,
in so far as I can, for the singular predicament in which I now find
myself placed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Proceed, my lord,&rdquo; said Mr. Mowbray; &ldquo;there is no denying the
singularity of your story, and I presume you are quite serious in giving
me such an extraordinary detail.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Entirely so, upon my honour&mdash;and a most serious m<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_289" id="vol_i_Page_289">[Pg&nbsp;289]</a></span>atter it is, you will
presently find. When my worthy uncle, Mr. S. Mowbray, (for I will not
call him Scrogie even in the grave,) paid his debt to nature, every
body concluded he would be found to have disinherited his son, the
unfilial Scrogie, and so far every body was right&mdash;But it was also
generally believed that he would settle the estate on my father, Lord
Etherington, the son of his sister, and therein every one was wrong. For
my excellent grand-uncle had pondered with himself, that the favoured
name of Mowbray would take no advantage, and attain no additional
elevation, if his estate of Nettlewood (otherwise called Mowbray-Park)
should descend to our family without any condition; and with the
assistance of a sharp attorney, he settled it on me, then a schoolboy,
<i>on condition</i> that I should, before attaining the age of twenty-five
complete, take unto myself in holy wedlock a young lady of good fame, of
the name of Mowbray, and, by preference, of the house of St. Ronan's,
should a damsel of that house exist.&mdash;Now my riddle is read.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And a very extraordinary one it is,&rdquo; replied Mowbray, thoughtfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Confess the truth,&rdquo; said Lord Etherington, laying his hand on his
shoulder; &ldquo;you think the story will bear a grain of a scruple of doubt,
if not a whole scruple itself?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At least, my lord,&rdquo; answered Mowbray, &ldquo;your lordship will allow, that,
being Miss Mowbray's only near relation, and sole guardian, I may,
without offence, pause upon a suit for her hand, made under such odd
circumstances.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you have the least doubt either respecting my rank or fortune, I can
give, of course, the most satisfactory references,&rdquo; said the Earl of
Etherington.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_290" id="vol_i_Page_290">[Pg&nbsp;290]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;That I can easily believe, my lord,&rdquo; said Mowbray; &ldquo;nor do I in the
least fear deception, where detection would be so easy. Your lordship's
proceedings towards me, too,&rdquo; (with a conscious glance at the bills he
still held in his hand,) &ldquo;have, I admit, been such as to intimate some
such deep cause of interest as you have been pleased to state. But it
seems strange that your lordship should have permitted years to glide
away, without so much as enquiring after the young lady, who, I believe,
is the only person qualified as your grand-uncle's will requires, with
whom you can form an alliance. It appears to me, that long before now,
this matter ought to have been investigated; and that, even now, it
would have been more natural and more decorous to have at least seen my
sister before proposing for her hand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;On the first point, my dear Mowbray,&rdquo; said Lord Etherington, &ldquo;I am free
to own to you, that, without meaning your sister the least affront, I
would have got rid of this clause if I could; for every man would fain
choose a wife for himself, and I feel no hurry to marry at all. But the
rogue-lawyers, after taking fees, and keeping me in hand for years, have
at length roundly told me the clause must be complied with, or
Nettlewood must have another master. So I thought it best to come down
here in person, in order to address the fair lady; but as accident has
hitherto prevented my seeing her, and as I found in her brother a man
who understands the world, I hope you will not think the worse of me,
that I have endeavoured in the outset to make you my friend. Truth is, I
shall be twenty-five in the course of a month; and w<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_291" id="vol_i_Page_291">[Pg&nbsp;291]</a></span>ithout your favour,
and the opportunities which only you can afford me, that seems a short
time to woo and win a lady of Miss Mowbray's merit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what is the alternative if you do not form this proposed alliance,
my lord?&rdquo; said Mowbray.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The bequest of my grand-uncle lapses,&rdquo; said the Earl, &ldquo;and fair
Nettlewood, with its old house, and older oaks, manorial rights, Hodge
Trampclod, and all, devolves on a certain cousin-german of mine, whom
Heaven of his mercy confound!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have left yourself little time to prevent such an event, my lord,&rdquo;
said Mowbray; &ldquo;but things being as I now see them, you shall have what
interest I can give you in the affair.&mdash;We must stand, however, on more
equal terms, my lord&mdash;I will condescend so far as to allow it would have
been inconvenient for me at this moment to have lost that game, but I
cannot in the circumstances think of acting as if I had fairly won it.
We must draw stakes, my lord.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a word of that, if you really mean me kindly, my dear Mowbray. The
blunder was a real one, for I was indeed thinking, as you may suppose,
on other things than the showing my point&mdash;All was fairly lost and
won.&mdash;I hope I shall have opportunities of offering real services, which
may perhaps give me some right to your partial regard&mdash;at present we are
on equal footing on all sides&mdash;perfectly so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If your lordship thinks so,&rdquo; said Mowbray,&mdash;and then passing rapidly to
what he felt he could say with more confidence,&mdash;&ldquo;Indeed, at any rate,
no personal obligation to myself could prevent my doing my full duty as
guardian to my sister.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Unquestionably, I desire nothing else,&rdquo; replied the Earl of
Etherington.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_292" id="vol_i_Page_292">[Pg&nbsp;292]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I must therefore understand that your lordship is quite serious in your
proposal; and that it is not to be withdrawn, even if upon acquaintance
with Miss Mowbray, you should not perhaps think her so deserving of your
lordship's attentions, as report may have spoken her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Mowbray,&rdquo; replied the Earl, &ldquo;the treaty between you and me shall be
as definite as if I were a sovereign prince, demanding in marriage the
sister of a neighbouring monarch, whom, according to royal etiquette, he
neither has seen nor could see. I have been quite frank with you, and I
have stated to you that my present motives for entering upon negotiation
are not personal, but territorial; when I know Miss Mowbray, I have no
doubt they will be otherwise. I have heard she is beautiful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Something of the palest, my lord,&rdquo; answered Mowbray.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A fine complexion is the first attraction which is lost in the world of
fashion, and that which it is easiest to replace.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dispositions, my lord, may differ,&rdquo; said Mowbray, &ldquo;without faults on
either side. I presume your lordship has enquired into my sister's. She
is amiable, accomplished, sensible, and high-spirited; but yet&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I understand you, Mr. Mowbray, and will spare you the pain of speaking
out. I have heard Miss Mowbray is in some respects&mdash;particular; to use a
broader word&mdash;a little whimsical.&mdash;No matter. She will have the less to
learn when she becomes a countess, and a woman of fashion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you serious, my lord?&rdquo; said Mowbray.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am&mdash;and I will speak my mind still more plainly. I hav<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_293" id="vol_i_Page_293">[Pg&nbsp;293]</a></span>e good temper,
and excellent spirits, and can endure a good deal of singularity in
those I live with. I have no doubt your sister and I will live happily
together&mdash;But in case it should prove otherwise, arrangements may be
made previously, which will enable us in certain circumstances to live
happily apart. My own estate is large, and Nettlewood will bear
dividing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, then,&rdquo; said Mowbray, &ldquo;I have little more to say&mdash;nothing indeed
remains for enquiry, so far as your lordship is concerned. But my sister
must have free liberty of choice&mdash;so far as I am concerned, your
lordship's suit has my interest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I trust we may consider it as a done thing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;With Clara's approbation&mdash;certainly,&rdquo; answered Mowbray.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I trust there is no chance of personal repugnance on the young lady's
part?&rdquo; said the young peer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I anticipate nothing of the kind, my lord,&rdquo; answered Mowbray, &ldquo;as I
presume there is no reason for any; but young ladies will be capricious,
and if Clara, after I have done and said all that a brother ought to do,
should remain repugnant, there is a point in the exertion of my
influence which it would be cruelty to pass.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Earl of Etherington walked a turn through the apartment, then
paused, and said, in a grave and doubtful tone, &ldquo;In the meanwhile, I am
bound, and the young lady is free, Mowbray. Is this quite fair?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is what happens in every case, my lord, where a gentleman proposes
for a lady,&rdquo; answered Mowbray; &ldquo;he must remain, of course, bound by his
offer, until, withi<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_294" id="vol_i_Page_294">[Pg&nbsp;294]</a></span>n a reasonable time, it is accepted or rejected. It
is not my fault that your lordship has declared your wishes to me,
before ascertaining Clara's inclination. But while as yet the matter is
between ourselves&mdash;I make you welcome to draw back if you think proper.
Clara Mowbray needs not push for a catch-match.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nor do I desire,&rdquo; said the young nobleman, &ldquo;any time to reconsider the
resolution which I have confided to you. I am not in the least fearful
that I shall change my mind on seeing your sister, and I am ready to
stand by the proposal which I have made to you.&mdash;If, however, you feel
so extremely delicately on my account,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;I can see and
even converse with Miss Mowbray at this f&ecirc;te of yours, without the
necessity of being at all presented to her&mdash;The character which I have
assumed in a manner obliges me to wear a mask.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said the Laird of St. Ronan's, &ldquo;and I am glad, for both our
sakes, your lordship thinks of taking a little law upon this occasion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall profit nothing by it,&rdquo; said the Earl; &ldquo;my doom is fixed before
I start&mdash;but if this mode of managing the matter will save your
conscience, I have no objection to it&mdash;it cannot consume much time,
which is what I have to look to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They then shook hands and parted, without any farther discourse which
could interest the reader.</p>

<p>Mowbray was glad to find himself alone, in order to think over what had
happened, and to ascertain the state of his own mind, which at present
was puzzling even to himself. He could not but feel that much greater
advantages of every kind might accrue to himself and his family from the
alliance of the wealthy young Earl, than could have been derived from<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_295" id="vol_i_Page_295">[Pg&nbsp;295]</a></span>
any share of his spoils which he had proposed to gain by superior
address in play, or greater skill on the turf. But his pride was hurt
when he recollected that he had placed himself entirely in Lord
Etherington's power; and the escape from absolute ruin which he had
made, solely by the sufferance of his opponent, had nothing in it
consolatory to his wounded feelings. He was lowered in his own eyes,
when he recollected how completely the proposed victim of his ingenuity
had seen through his schemes, and only abstained from baffling them
entirely, because to do so suited best with his own. There was a shade
of suspicion, too, which he could not entirely eradicate from his
mind.&mdash;What occasion had this young nobleman to preface, by the
voluntary loss of a brace of thousands, a proposal which must have been
acceptable in itself, without any such sacrifice? And why should he,
after all, have been so eager to secure his accession to the proposed
alliance, before he had even seen the lady who was the object of it?
However hurried for time, he might have waited the event at least of the
entertainment at Shaws-Castle, at which Clara was necessarily obliged to
make her appearance.&mdash;Yet such conduct, however unusual, was equally
inconsistent with any sinister intentions; since the sacrifice of a
large sum of money, and the declaration of his views upon a portionless
young lady of family, could scarcely be the preface to any unfair
practice. So that, upon the whole, Mowbray settled, that what was
uncommon in the Earl's conduct arose from the hasty and eager
disposition of a rich young Englishman, to whom money is of little
consequence, and who is too headlong in pursuit of the favourite plan of
the moment, to proce<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_296" id="vol_i_Page_296">[Pg&nbsp;296]</a></span>ed in the most rational or most ordinary manner. If,
however, there should prove any thing farther in the matter than he
could at present discover, Mowbray promised himself that the utmost
circumspection on his part could not fail to discover it, and that in
full time to prevent any ill consequences to his sister or himself.</p>

<p>Immersed in such cogitations, he avoided the inquisitive presence of Mr.
Meiklewham, who, as usual, had been watching for him to learn how
matters were going on; and although it was now late, he mounted his
horse, and rode hastily to Shaws-Castle. On the way, he deliberated with
himself whether to mention to his sister the application which had been
made to him, in order to prepare her to receive the young Earl as a
suitor, favoured with her brother's approbation. &ldquo;But no, no, no;&rdquo; such
was the result of his contemplation. &ldquo;She might take it into her head
that his thoughts were bent less upon having her for a countess, than on
obtaining possession of his grand-uncle's estate.&mdash;We must keep quiet,&rdquo;
concluded he, &ldquo;until her personal appearance and accomplishments may<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_297" id="vol_i_Page_297">[Pg&nbsp;297]</a></span>
appear at least to have some influence upon his choice.&mdash;We must say
nothing till this blessed entertainment has been given and received.&rdquo;</p>

</p>


<p>Mowbray had no sooner left the Earl's apartment, than the latter
commenced an epistle to a friend and associate, which we lay before the
reader, as best calculated to illustrate the views and motives of the
writer. It was addressed to Captain Jekyl, of the &mdash;&mdash; regiment of
Guards, at the Green Dragon, Harrowgate, and was of the following
tenor:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Harry</span>,</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have expected you here these ten days past, anxiously as ever
man was looked for; and have now to charge your absence as high
treason to your sworn allegiance. Surely you do not presume, like
one of Napoleon's new-made monarchs, to grumble for independence,
as if your greatness were of your own making, or as if I had picked
you out of the whole of St. James's coffee-house to hold my
back-hand, for your sake, forsooth, not for my own? Wherefore, lay
aside all your own proper business, be it the pursuit of dowagers,
or the plucking of pigeons, and instantly repair to this place,
where I may speedily want your assistance.&mdash;<i>May</i> want it<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_298" id="vol_i_Page_298">[Pg&nbsp;298]</a></span>, said I?
Why, most negligent of friends and allies, I <i>have</i> wanted it
already, and that when it might have done me yeoman's service.
Know that I have had an affair since I came hither&mdash;have got hurt
myself, and have nearly shot my friend; and if I had, I might have
been hanged for it, for want of Harry Jekyl to bear witness in my
favour. I was so far on my road to this place, when, not choosing,
for certain reasons, to pass through the old village, I struck by a
footpath into the woods which separate it from the new Spa, leaving
my carriage and people to go the carriage-way. I had not walked
half a mile when I heard the footsteps of some one behind, and,
looking round, what should I behold but the face in the world which
I most cordially hate and abhor&mdash;I mean that which stands on the
shoulders of my right trusty and well-beloved cousin and
counsellor, Saint Francis. He seemed as much confounded as I was at
our unexpected meeting; and it was a minute ere he found breath to
demand what I did in Scotland, contrary to my promise, as he was
pleased to express it.&mdash;I retaliated, and charged him with being
here, in contradiction to his.&mdash;He justified, and said he had only
come down upon the express information that I was upon my road to
St. Ronan's.&mdash;Now, Harry, how the devil should he have known this
hadst thou been quite faithful? for I am sure, to no ear but thine
own did I breathe a whisper of my purpose.&mdash;Next, with the insolent
assumption of superiority, which he founds on what he calls the
rectitude of his purpose, he proposed we should both withdraw from
a neighbourhood into which we could bring nothing but
wretchedness.&mdash;I have told you how difficult it is to cope with the
calm and resolute manner that the devil gifts him with on such
occasions; but I was determined he should not carry the day this
time. I saw no chance for it, however, but to put myself into a
towering passion, which, thank Heaven, I can always do on<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_299" id="vol_i_Page_299">[Pg&nbsp;299]</a></span> short
notice.&mdash;I charged him with having imposed formerly on my youth,
and made himself judge of my rights; and I accompanied my defiance
with the strongest terms of irony and contempt, as well as with
demand of instant satisfaction. I had my travelling pistols with
me, (<i>et pour cause</i>,) and, to my surprise, my gentleman was
equally provided.&mdash;For fair play's sake, I made him take one of my
pistols&mdash;right Kuchenritters&mdash;a brace of balls in each, but that
circumstance I forgot.&mdash;I would fain have argued the matter a
little longer; but I thought at the time, and think still, that the
best arguments which he and I can exchange, must come from the
point of the sword, or the muzzle of the pistol.&mdash;We fired nearly
together, and I think both dropped&mdash;I am sure I did, but recovered
in a minute, with a damaged arm and a scratch on the temple&mdash;it was
the last which stunned me&mdash;so much for double-loaded pistols.&mdash;My
friend was invisible, and I had nothing for it but to walk to the
Spa, bleeding all the way like a calf, and tell a
raw-head-and-bloody-bone story about a footpad, which, but for my
earldom, and my gory locks, no living soul would have believed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shortly after, when I had been installed in a sick room, I had the
mortification to learn, that my own impatience had brought all this
mischief upon me, at a moment when I had every chance of getting
rid of my friend without trouble, had I but let him go on his own
errand; for it seems he had an appointment that morning with a
booby Baronet, who is said to be a bullet-slitter, and would
perhaps have rid me of Saint Francis without any trouble or risk on
my part. Meantime, his non-appearance at this rendezvous has placed
Master Francis Tyrrel, as he chooses to call himself, in the worst
odour possible with the gentry at the Spring, who have denounced
him as a coward and no gentleman.&mdash;What to think of the business
myself, I know not; and I much want your assistance to see what can
have become of <span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_300" id="vol_i_Page_300">[Pg&nbsp;300]</a></span>this fellow, who, like a spectre of ill omen, has so
often thwarted and baffled my best plans. My own confinement
renders me inactive, though my wound is fast healing. Dead he
cannot be; for, had he been mortally wounded, we should have heard
of him somewhere or other&mdash;he could not have vanished from the
earth like a bubble of the elements. Well and sound he cannot be;
for, besides that I am sure I saw him stagger and drop, firing his
pistol as he fell, I know him well enough to swear, that, had he
not been severely wounded, he would have first pestered me with his
accursed presence and assistance, and then walked forward with his
usual composure to settle matters with Sir Bingo Binks.
No&mdash;no&mdash;Saint Francis is none of those who leave such jobs half
finished&mdash;it is but doing him justice to say, he has the devil's
courage to back his own deliberate impertinence. But then, if
wounded severely, he must be still in this neighbourhood, and
probably in concealment&mdash;this is what I must discover, and I want
your assistance in my enquiries among the natives.&mdash;Haste hither,
Harry, as ever you look for good at my hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A good player, Harry, always studies to make the best of bad
cards&mdash;and so I have endeavoured to turn my wound to some account;
and it has given me the opportunity to secure Monsieur le Frere in
my interests. You say very truly, that it is of consequence to me
to know the character of this new actor on the disordered scene of
my adventures.&mdash;Know, then, he is that most incongruous of all
monsters&mdash;a Scotch Buck&mdash;how far from being buck of the season you
may easily judge. Every point of national character is opposed to
the pretensions of this luckless race, when they attempt to take on
them a personage which is assumed with so much facility by their
brethren of the Isle of Saints. They are a shrewd people, indeed,
but so destitute of ease, grace, pliability of manners, and
insinuation of address, that they eternally seem to suffer actual
misery in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_301" id="vol_i_Page_301">[Pg&nbsp;301]</a></span>ir attempts to look gay and careless. Then their pride
heads them back at one turn, their poverty at another, their
pedantry at a third, their <i>mauvaise honte</i> at a fourth; and with
so many obstacles to make them bolt off the course, it is
positively impossible they should win the plate. No, Harry, it is
the grave folk in Old England who have to fear a Caledonian
invasion&mdash;they will make no conquests in the world of fashion.
Excellent bankers the Scots may be, for they are eternally
calculating how to add interest to principal;&mdash;good soldiers, for
they are, if not such heroes as they would be thought, as brave, I
suppose, as their neighbours, and much more amenable to
discipline;&mdash;lawyers they are born; indeed every country gentleman
is bred one, and their patient and crafty disposition enables them,
in other lines, to submit to hardships which other natives could
not bear, and avail themselves of advantages which others would let
pass under their noses unavailingly. But assuredly Heaven did not
form the Caledonian for the gay world; and his efforts at ease,
grace, and gaiety, resemble only the clumsy gambols of the ass in
the fable. Yet the Scot has his sphere too, (in his own country
only,) where the character which he assumes is allowed to pass
current. This Mowbray, now&mdash;this brother-in-law of mine&mdash;might do
pretty well at a Northern Meeting, or the Leith races, where he
could give five minutes to the sport of the day, and the next half
hour to county politics, or to farming; but it is scarce necessary
to tell you, Harry, that this half fellowship will not pass on the
better side of the Tweed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yet, for all I have told you, this trout was not easily tickled;
nor should I have made much of him, had he not, in the plenitude of
his northern conceit, entertained that notion of my being a good
subject of plunder, which you had contrived (blessings on your
contriving brain!) to insinuate into him by means of Wolverine. He
co<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_302" id="vol_i_Page_302">[Pg&nbsp;302]</a></span>mmenced this hopeful experiment, and, as you must have
anticipated, caught a Tartar with a vengeance. Of course, I used
my victory only so far as to secure his interest in accomplishing
my principal object; and yet, I could see my gentleman's pride was
so much injured in the course of the negotiation, that not all the
advantages which the match offered to his damned family, were able
entirely to subdue the chagrin arising from his defeat. He did gulp
it down, though, and we are friends and allies, for the present at
least&mdash;not so cordially so, however, as to induce me to trust him
with the whole of the strangely complicated tale. The circumstance
of the will it was necessary to communicate, as affording a
sufficiently strong reason for urging my suit; and this partial
disclosure enabled me for the present to dispense with farther
confidence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will observe, that I stand by no means secure; and besides the
chance of my cousin's reappearance&mdash;a certain event, unless he is
worse than I dare hope for&mdash;I have perhaps to expect the fantastic
repugnance of Clara herself, or some sulky freak on her brother's
part.&mdash;In a word&mdash;and let it be such a one as conjurers raise the
devil with&mdash;Harry Jekyl, I <i>want</i> you.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As well knowing the nature of my friend, I can assure you that his
own interest, as well as mine, may be advanced by his coming hither
on duty. Here is a blockhead, whom I already mentioned, Sir Bingo
Binks, with whom something may be done worth <i>your</i> while, though
scarce worth <i>mine</i>. The Baronet is a perfect buzzard, and when I
came here he was under Mowbray's training. But the awkward Scot had
plucked half-a-dozen penfeathers from his wing with so little
precaution, that the Baronet has become frightened and shy, and is
now in the act of rebelling against Mowbray, whom he both hates and
fears&mdash;the least backing from a knowing hand like you, and the bird
becomes your own, feathers and all.&mdash;Moreover,</p>

years ago; and so little was charged for a domestic's living when the
author became first acquainted with the road, that a shilling or
eighteenpence was sufficient board wages for a man-servant, when a crown
would not now answer the purpose. It is true the cause of these
reasonable charges rested upon a principle equally unjust to the
landlord, and inconvenient to the guest. The landlord did not expect to
make any thing upon the charge for eating which his bill contained; in
consideration of which, the guest was expected to drink more wine than
might be convenient or agreeable to him, &ldquo;<i>for the good</i>,&rdquo; as it was
called, &ldquo;<i>of the house</i>.&rdquo; The landlord indeed was willing and ready to
assist, in this duty, every stranger who came within his gates. Other
things were in proportion. A charge for lodging, fire, and candle, was
long a thing unheard of in Scotland. A shilling to the housemaid settled
all such considerations. I see, from memorandums of 1790, that a young
man, with two ponies and a serving-lad, might travel from the house of
one Meg Dods to another, through most parts of Scotland, for about five
or six shillings a-day.</p></div>

<h2><a name="vol_i_AUTHORS_NOTES" id="vol_i_AUTHORS_NOTES"></a>AUTHOR'S NOTES.</h2>


<h3><a name="vol_i_Note_I" id="vol_i_Note_I"></a>Note I., p. 14.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Building-Feus in Scotland</span>.</h3>

<p>In Scotland a village is erected upon a species of landright, very
different from the copyhold so frequent in England. Every alienation or
sale of landed property must be made in the shape of a feudal
conveyance, and the party who acquires it holds thereby an absolute and
perfect right of property in the fief, while he discharges the
stipulations of the vassal, and, above all, pays the feu-duties. The
vassal or tenant of the site of the smallest cottage holds his
possession as absolutely as the proprietor, of whose large estate it is
perhaps scarce a perceptible portion. By dint of excellent laws, the
sasines, or deeds of delivery of such fiefs, are placed on record in
such order, that every burden affecting the property can be seen for
payment of a very moderate fee; so that a person proposing to lend money
upon it, knows exactly the nature and extent of his security.</p>

<p>From the nature of these landrights being so explicit and secure, the
Scottish people have been led to entertain a jealousy of
building-leases, of however long duration. Not long ago, a great landed
proprietor took the latter mode of disposing of some ground near a
thriving town in the west country. The number of years in the lease was
settled at nine hundred and ninety-nine. All was agreed to, and the
deeds were ordered to be drawn. But the tenant, as he walked down the
avenue, began to reflect that the lease, though so very long as to be
almost perpetual, nevertheless had a termination; and that after the
lapse of a thousand years, lacking one, the connexion of his family and
representatives with the estate would cease. He took a qualm at the
thought of the loss to be sustained by his posterity a thousand years
hence; and going back to the ho<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_306" id="vol_i_Page_306">[Pg&nbsp;306]</a></span>use of the gentleman who feued the
ground, he demanded, and readily obtained, the additional term of fifty
years to be added to the lease.</p>


<h3><a name="vol_i_Note_II" id="vol_i_Note_II"></a>Note II., p. 90.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Dark Ladye</span>.</h3>

<p>The Dark Ladye is one of those tantalizing fragments, in which Mr.
Coleridge has shown us what exquisite powers of poetry he has suffered
to remain uncultivated. Let us be thankful for what we have received,
however. The unfashioned ore, drawn from so rich a mine, is worth all to
which art can add its highest decorations, when drawn from less abundant
sources. The verses beginning the poem which are published separately,
are said to have soothed the last hours of Mr. Fox. They are the stanzas
entitled <span class="smcap">Love</span>.</p>


<h3><a name="vol_i_Note_III" id="vol_i_Note_III"></a>Note III., p. 252.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Mago-Pico</span>.</h3>

<p>This satire, very popular even in Scotland, at least with one party, was
composed at the expense of a reverend presbyterian divine, of whom many
stories are preserved, being Mr. Pyet, the Mago-Pico of the Tale,
minister of Dunbar. The work is now little known in Scotland, and not at
all in England, though written with much strong and coarse humour,
resembling the style of Arbuthnot. It was composed by Mr. Haliburton, a
military chaplain. The distresses attending Mago-Pico's bachelor life,
are thus stated:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;At the same time I desire you will only figure out to yourself his
situation during his celibacy in the ministerial charge&mdash;a house
lying all heaps upon heaps; his bed ill-made, swarming with fleas,
and very cold on the winter nights; his sheep's-head not to be
eaten for wool and hair, his broth singed, his bread mouldy, his
lamb and pig all scouthered, his house neither washed nor
plastered; his black stockings darned with white worsted above the
shoes; his butter made into cat's harns; his cheese one heap of
mites and maggots, and full of large avenues for rats and mice to
play at hide-and-seek and make their nests in. Frequent were the
admonitions he had given his maid-servants on this score, and every
now and then he was turning them off; but still the last was the
worst, and in the meanwhile the poor man was the sufferer. At any
rate, therefore, matrimony must turn to his account, though his
wife should prove to be nothing but a creature of the feminine
gender, with a tongue in her head, and ten fingers on her hands, to
clear out the papers of the housemaid, not to mention the
convenience of a man's having it in his power lawfully to beget
<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_i_Page_307" id="vol_i_Page_307">[Pg&nbsp;307]</a></span>sons and daughters in his own house.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Memoirs of Mago-Pico.

Some Scottish Protestants took pride in believing that their Kirk
descended from Culdees, who were not of the Roman Communion. The Culdees
have given rise to a world of dispute, and he would be a bold man who
pretended to understand their exact position. The name seems to be <i>Cele
De</i>, &ldquo;servant [gillie] of God.&rdquo; They were not Columban monks, but fill a
gap between the expulsion of the Columbans by the Picts, and the
Anglicising and Romanising of the Scottish Church by St. Margaret and
her sons. Originally solitary ascetics, they clustered into groups, and,
if we are to believe their supplanters at St. Andrews, the Canons
Regular, they were married men, and used church property for family
profit. Their mass they celebrated with a rite of their own, in their
little church. They were gradually merged in, and overpowered at St.
Andrews, for example, by the Canons Regular, and are last heard of in
prosecuting a claim to elect the Bishop, at the time of Edward the
First's interference with Scottish affairs. The points on which they
differed from Roman practice would probably have seemed very
insignificant to such a theologian as Meg Dods.</p></div>

reminiscences of Captain Basil Hall, published by Lockhart, he mentions
that Scott himself had a dislike of shooting, from a sentiment as to the
cruelty of the sport. &ldquo;I was never quite at ease when I had knocked down
my blackcock, and going to pick him up he cast back his dying eye with a
look of reproach. I don't affect to be more squeamish than my
neighbours, but I am not ashamed to say that no practice ever reconciled
me fully to the cruelty of the affair. At all events, now that I can do
as I like without fear of ridicule, I take more pleasure in seeing the
birds fly past me unharmed.&rdquo; (Lockhart, vii. 331.)</p></div>

<i>Hamlet.</i><br />
</p>


<p>The important day had now arrived, the arrangement
for which had for some time occupied all the
conversation and thoughts of the good company at
the Well of St. Ronan's. To give it, at the same
time, a degree of novelty and consequence, Lady
Penelope Penfeather had long since suggested to
Mr. Mowbray, that the more gifted and accomplished
part of the guests might contribute to furnish out
entertainment for the rest, by acting a few scenes
of some popular drama; an accomplishment in
which her self-conceit assured her that she was
peculiarly qualified to excel. Mr. Mowbray, who
seemed on this occasion to have thrown the reins
entirely into her ladyship's hands, made no objection
to the plan which she proposed, excepting that
the old-fashioned hedges and walks of the garden
at Shaws-Castle must necessarily serve for stage
<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_2" id="vol_ii_Page_2">[Pg&nbsp;2]</a></span>and scenery, as there was no time to fit up the old
hall for the exhibition of the proposed theatricals.<a name="vol_ii_FNanchor_1_1" id="vol_ii_FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#vol_ii_Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
But upon enquiry among the company, this plan
was wrecked upon the ordinary shelve, to wit, the
difficulty of finding performers who would consent
to assume the lower characters of the drama. For
the first parts there were candidates more than
enough; but most of these were greatly too high-spirited
to play the fool, except they were permitted
to top the part. Then amongst the few unambitious
underlings, who could be coaxed or cajoled
to undertake subordinate characters, there were so
many bad memories, and short memories, and
treacherous memories, that at length the plan was
resigned in despair.</p>

<p>A substitute, proposed by Lady Penelope, was
next considered. It was proposed to act what the
Italians call a Comedy of Character; that is, not
an exact drama, in which the actors deliver what
is set down for them by the author; but one, in
which the plot having been previously fixed upon,
and a few striking scenes adjusted, the actors are
expected to supply the dialogue extempore, or, as
Petruchio says, from their mother wit. This is an
amusement which affords much entertainment in
Italy, particularly in the state of Venice, where the
characters of their drama have been long since all
previously fixed, and are handed down by tradition;
and this species of drama, though rather belonging
<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_3" id="vol_ii_Page_3">[Pg&nbsp;3]</a></span>to the mask than the theatre, is distinguished by
the name of Commedia dell' Arte.<a name="vol_ii_FNanchor_2_2" id="vol_ii_FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#vol_ii_Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> But the shamefaced
character of Britons is still more alien from
a species of display, where there is a constant and
extemporaneous demand for wit, or the sort of ready
small-talk which supplies its place, than from the
regular exhibitions of the drama, where the author,
standing responsible for language and sentiment,
leaves to the personators of the scenes only the
trouble of finding enunciation and action.</p>

<p>But the ardent and active spirit of Lady Penelope,
still athirst after novelty, though baffled in her two
first projects, brought forward a third, in which
she was more successful. This was the proposal to
combine a certain number, at least, of the guests,
properly dressed for the occasion, as representing
some well-known historical or dramatic characters,
in a group, having reference to history, or to a scene
of the drama. In this representation, which may
be called playing a picture, action, even pantomimical
action, was not expected; and all that was
required of the performers, was to throw themselves
into such a group as might express a marked and
striking point of an easily remembered scene, but
where the actors are at a pause, and without either
speech or motion. In this species of representation
there was no tax, either on the invention or memory
of those who might undertake parts; and, what
recommended it still farther to the good company,
there was no marked difference betwixt the hero
and heroine of the group, and the less distinguished
characters by whom they were attended on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_4" id="vol_ii_Page_4">[Pg&nbsp;4]</a></span>
stage; and every one who had confidence in a handsome
shape and a becoming dress, might hope,
though standing in not quite so broad and favourable
a light as the principal personages, to draw,
nevertheless, a considerable portion of attention
and applause. This motion, therefore, that the
company, or such of them as might choose to
appear properly dressed for the occasion, should
form themselves into one or more groups, which
might be renewed and varied as often as they
pleased, was hailed and accepted as a bright idea,
which assigned to every one a share of the importance
attached to its probable success.</p>

<p>Mowbray, on his side, promised to contrive some
arrangement which should separate the actors in
this mute drama from the spectators, and enable the
former to vary the amusement, by withdrawing
themselves from the scene, and again appearing
upon it under a different and new combination.
This plan of exhibition, where fine clothes and
affected attitudes supplied all draughts upon fancy
or talent, was highly agreeable to most of the ladies
present; and even Lady Binks, whose discontent
seemed proof against every effort that could be proposed
to soothe it, acquiesced in the project, with
perfect indifference indeed, but with something less
of sullenness than usual.</p>

<p>It now only remained to rummage the circulating
library, for some piece of sufficient celebrity to
command attention, and which should be at the
same time suited to the execution of their project.
Bell's British Theatre, Miller's Modern and Ancient
Drama, and about twenty odd volumes, in which
stray tragedies and comedies were associated, like
the passengers in a mail-coach, without the least<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_5" id="vol_ii_Page_5">[Pg&nbsp;5]</a></span>
attempt at selection or arrangement, were all
examined in the course of their researches. But
Lady Penelope declared loftily and decidedly for
Shakspeare, as the author whose immortal works
were fresh in every one's recollection. Shakspeare
was therefore chosen, and from his works the
Midsummer Night's Dream was selected, as the
play which afforded the greatest variety of characters,
and most scope of course for the intended
representation. An active competition presently
occurred among the greater part of the company,
for such copies of the Midsummer Night's Dream,
or the volume of Shakspeare containing it, as could
be got in the neighbourhood; for, notwithstanding
Lady Penelope's declaration, that every one who
could read had Shakspeare's plays by heart, it
appeared that such of his dramas as have not kept
possession of the stage, were very little known at
St. Ronan's, save among those people who are
emphatically called readers.</p>

<p>The adjustment of the parts was the first subject
of consideration, so soon as those who intended to
assume characters had refreshed their recollection
on the subject of the piece. Theseus was unanimously
assigned to Mowbray, the giver of the
entertainment, and therefore justly entitled to
represent the Duke of Athens. The costume of an
Amazonian crest and plume, a tucked-up vest, and
a tight buskin of sky-blue silk, buckled with
diamonds, reconciled Lady Binks to the part of
Hippolyta. The superior stature of Miss Mowbray
to Lady Penelope, made it necessary that the
former should perform the part of Helena, and her
ladyship rest contented with the shrewish character
of Hermia. It was resolved to compliment the<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_6" id="vol_ii_Page_6">[Pg&nbsp;6]</a></span>
young Earl of Etherington with the part of Lysander,
which, however, his lordship declined, and, preferring
comedy to tragedy, refused to appear in any other
character than that of the magnanimous Bottom;
and he gave them such a humorous specimen of his
quality in that part, that all were delighted at once
with his condescension in assuming, and his skill in
performing, the presenter of Pyramus.</p>

<p>The part of Egeus was voted to Captain MacTurk,
whose obstinacy in refusing to appear in any other
than the full Highland garb, had nearly disconcerted
the whole affair. At length this obstacle was got
over, on the authority of Childe Harold, who remarks
the similarity betwixt the Highland and Grecian
costume,<a name="vol_ii_FNanchor_3_3" id="vol_ii_FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#vol_ii_Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and the company, dispensing with the
difference of colour, voted the Captain's variegated
kilt, of the MacTurk tartan, to be the kirtle of a
Grecian mountaineer,&mdash;Egeus to be an Arnout,
and the Captain to be Egeus. Chatterly and the
painter, walking gentlemen by profession, agreed
to walk through the parts of Demetrius and
Lysander, the two Athenian lovers; and Mr.
Winterblossom, loath and lazy, after many excuses,
was bribed by Lady Penelope with an antique,
or supposed antique cameo, to play the part of
Philostratus, master of the revels, provided his
gout would permit him to remain so long upon
the turf, which was to be their stage.</p>

<p>Muslin trowsers, adorned with spangles, a volu<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_7" id="vol_ii_Page_7">[Pg&nbsp;7]</a></span>minous
turban of silver gauze, and wings of the
same, together with an embroidered slipper, converted
at once Miss Digges into Oberon, the King
of Shadows, whose sovereign gravity, however, was
somewhat indifferently represented by the silly
gaiety of Miss in her Teens, and the uncontrolled
delight which she felt in her fine clothes. A younger
sister represented Titania; and two or three subordinate
elves were selected, among families attending
the salutiferous fountain, who were easily persuaded
to let their children figure in fine clothes at so
juvenile an age, though they shook their head
at Miss Digges and her pantaloons, and no less at
the liberal display of Lady Binks's right leg, with
which the Amazonian garb gratified the public of
St. Ronan's.</p>

<p>Dr. Quackleben was applied to to play Wall, by
the assistance of such a wooden horse, or screen, as
clothes are usually dried upon; the old Attorney
stood for Lion; and the other characters of Bottom's
drama were easily found among the unnamed frequenters
of the Spring. Dressed rehearsals, and
so forth, went merrily on&mdash;all voted there was a
play fitted.</p>

<p>But even the Doctor's eloquence could not press
Mrs. Blower into the scheme, although she was
particularly wanted to represent Thisbe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Truth is,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;I dinna greatly like
stage-plays. John Blower, honest man, as sailors
are aye for some spree or another, wad take me
ance to see ane Mrs. Siddons&mdash;I thought we should
hae been crushed to death before we gat in&mdash;a' my
things riven aff my back, forby the four lily-white
shillings that it cost us&mdash;and then in came three
frightsome carlines wi' besoms, and they wad<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_8" id="vol_ii_Page_8">[Pg&nbsp;8]</a></span>
bewitch a sailor's wife&mdash;I was lang eneugh there&mdash;and
out I wad be, and out John Blower gat me,
but wi' nae sma' fight and fend.&mdash;My Lady
Penelope Penfitter, and the great folk, may just
take it as they like; but in my mind, Dr. Cacklehen,
it's a mere blasphemy for folk to gar themselves
look otherwise than their Maker made them; and
then the changing the name which was given them
at baptism, is, I think, an awful falling away from
our vows; and though Thisby, which I take to be
Greek for Tibbie, may be a very good name, yet
Margaret was I christened, and Margaret will I
die.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mistake the matter entirely, my dear Mrs.
Blower,&rdquo; said the Doctor; &ldquo;there is nothing serious
intended&mdash;a mere <i>placebo</i>&mdash;just a divertisement
to cheer the spirits, and assist the effect of the
waters&mdash;cheerfulness is a great promoter of health.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dinna tell me o' health, Dr. Kittlepin!&mdash;Can
it be for the puir body M'Durk's health to major
about in the tartans like a tobacconist's sign in a
frosty morning, wi' his poor wizzened houghs as blue
as a blawort?&mdash;weel I wot he is a humbling spectacle.
Or can it gie ony body health or pleasure either to
see your ainsell, Doctor, ganging about wi' a claise
screen tied to your back, covered wi' paper, and
painted like a stane and lime wa'?&mdash;I'll gang to
see nane o' their vanities, Dr. Kittlehen; and if
there is nae other decent body to take care o' me,
as I dinna like to sit a haill afternoon by mysell,
I'll e'en gae doun to Mr. Sowerbrowst the maltster's&mdash;he
is a pleasant, sensible man, and a sponsible
man in the world, and his sister's a very decent
woman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Confound Sowerbrowst,&rdquo; thought the Doctor;<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_9" id="vol_ii_Page_9">[Pg&nbsp;9]</a></span>
&ldquo;if I had guessed he was to come across me thus,
he should not have got the better of his dyspepsy
so early.&mdash;My dear Mrs. Blower,&rdquo; he continued,
but aloud, &ldquo;it is a foolish affair enough, I must
confess; but every person of style and fashion at
the Well has settled to attend this exhibition; there
has been nothing else talked of for this month
through the whole country, and it will be a year
before it is forgotten. And I would have you consider
how ill it will look, my dear Mrs. Blower, to
stay away&mdash;nobody will believe you had a card&mdash;no,
not though you were to hang it round your neck
like a label round a vial of tincture, Mrs. Blower.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If ye thought <i>that</i>, Doctor Kickherben,&rdquo; said
the widow, alarmed at the idea of losing caste, &ldquo;I
wad e'en gang to the show, like other folk; sinful
and shameful if it be, let them that make the sin
bear the shame. But then I will put on nane of
their Popish disguises&mdash;me that has lived in North
Leith, baith wife and lass, for I shanna say how
mony years, and has a character to keep up baith
with saint and sinner.&mdash;And then, wha's to take
care of me, since you are gaun to make a lime-and-stane
wa' of yoursell, Dr. Kickinben?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear Mrs. Blower, if such is your determination,
I will not make a wall of myself. Her
ladyship must consider my profession&mdash;she must
understand it is my function to look after my
patients, in preference to all the stage-plays in this
world&mdash;and to attend on a case like yours, Mrs.
Blower, it is my duty to sacrifice, were it called for,
the whole drama from Shakspeare to O'Keefe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On hearing this magnanimous resolution, the
widow's heart was greatly cheered; for, in fact, she
might probably have considered the Doctor's per<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_10" id="vol_ii_Page_10">[Pg&nbsp;10]</a></span>severance
in the plan, of which she had expressed
such high disapprobation, as little less than a symptom
of absolute defection from his allegiance. By
an accommodation, therefore, which suited both
parties, it was settled that the Doctor should attend
his loving widow to Shaws-Castle, without mask
or mantle; and that the painted screen should be
transferred from Quackleben's back to the broad
shoulders of a briefless barrister, well qualified for
the part of Wall, since the composition of his skull
might have rivalled in solidity the mortar and stone
of the most approved builder.</p>

<p>We must not pause to dilate upon the various
labours of body and spirit which preceded the intervening
space, betwixt the settlement of this gay
scheme, and the time appointed to carry it into
execution. We will not attempt to describe how
the wealthy, by letter and by commissioners, urged
their researches through the stores of the Gallery
of Fashion for specimens of Oriental finery&mdash;how
they that were scant of diamonds supplied their
place with paste and Bristol stones&mdash;how the country
dealers were driven out of patience by the
demand for goods of which they had never before
heard the name&mdash;and, lastly, how the busy fingers
of the more economical damsels twisted handkerchiefs
into turbans, and converted petticoats into
pantaloons, shaped and sewed, cut and clipped, and
spoiled many a decent gown and petticoat, to produce
something like a Grecian habit. Who can
describe the wonders wrought by active needles and
scissors, aided by thimbles and thread, upon silver
gauze, and sprigged muslin? or who can show how,
if the fair nymphs of the Spring did not entirely
succeed in attaining the desired resemblance to<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_11" id="vol_ii_Page_11">[Pg&nbsp;11]</a></span>
heathen Greeks, they at least contrived to get rid
of all similitude to sober Christians?</p>

<p>Neither is it necessary to dwell upon the various
schemes of conveyance which were resorted to, in
order to transfer the beau monde of the Spa to
the scene of revelry at Shaws-Castle. These were
as various as the fortunes and pretensions of the
owners; from the lordly curricle, with its outriders,
to the humble taxed cart, nay, untaxed cart, which
conveyed the personages of lesser rank. For the
latter, indeed, the two post-chaises at the Inn seemed
converted into hourly stages, so often did they
come and go between the Hotel and the Castle&mdash;a
glad day for the postilions, and a day of martyrdom
for the poor post-horses; so seldom is it that
every department of any society, however constituted,
can be injured or benefited by the same occurrence.</p>

<p>Such, indeed, was the penury of vehicular conveyance,
that applications were made in manner
most humble, even to Meg Dods herself, entreating
she would permit her old whiskey to <i>ply</i> (for such
might have been the phrase) at St. Ronan's Well,
for that day only, and that upon good cause shown.
But not for sordid lucre would the undaunted spirit
of Meg compound her feud with her neighbours of
the detested Well. &ldquo;Her carriage,&rdquo; she briefly
replied, &ldquo;was engaged for her ain guest and the
minister, and deil anither body's fit should gang
intill't. Let every herring hing by its ain head.&rdquo;
And, accordingly, at the duly appointed hour,
creaked forth, the leathern convenience, in which,
carefully screened by the curtain from the gaze of
the fry of the village, sat Nabob Touchwood, in the
costume of an Indian merchant, or Shroff, as they
are termed. The clergyman would not, perhaps,<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_12" id="vol_ii_Page_12">[Pg&nbsp;12]</a></span>
have been so punctual, had not a set of notes and
messages from his friend at the Cleikum, ever following
each other as thick as the papers which
decorate the tail of a schoolboy's kite, kept him so
continually on the alert from daybreak till noon,
that Mr. Touchwood found him completely dressed;
and the whiskey was only delayed for about ten
minutes before the door of the manse, a space
employed by Mr. Cargill in searching for the spectacles,
which at last were happily discovered upon
his own nose.</p>

<p>At length, seated by the side of his new friend,
Mr. Cargill arrived safe at Shaws-Castle, the gate
of which mansion was surrounded by a screaming
group of children, so extravagantly delighted at
seeing the strange figures to whom each successive
carriage gave birth, that even the stern brow and
well-known voice of Johnie Tirlsneck, the beadle,
though stationed in the court on express purpose,
was not equal to the task of controlling them.
These noisy intruders, however, who, it was believed,
were somewhat favoured by Clara Mowbray, were
excluded from the court which opened before the
house, by a couple of grooms or helpers armed
with their whips, and could only salute, with their
shrill and wondering hailing, the various personages,
as they passed down a short avenue leading
from the exterior gate.</p>

<p>The Cleikum nabob and the minister were greeted
with shouts not the least clamorous; which the
former merited by the ease with which he wore the
white turban, and the latter, by the infrequency of
his appearance in public, and both, by the singular
association of a decent clergyman of the church of
Scotland, in a dress more old-fashioned than could<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_13" id="vol_ii_Page_13">[Pg&nbsp;13]</a></span>
now be produced in the General Assembly, walking
arm in arm, and seemingly in the most familiar
terms, with a Parsee merchant. They stopped a
moment at the gate of the court-yard to admire the
front of the old mansion, which had been disturbed
with so unusual a scene of gaiety.</p>

<p>Shaws-Castle, though so named, presented no
appearance of defence; and the present edifice had
never been designed for more than the accommodation
of a peaceful family, having a low, heavy
front, loaded with some of that meretricious ornament,
which, uniting, or rather confounding, the
Gothic and Grecian architecture, was much used
during the reigns of James VI. of Scotland, and his
unfortunate son. The court formed a small square,
two sides of which were occupied by such buildings
as were required for the family, and the third by
the stables, the only part to which much attention
had been paid, the present Mr. Mowbray having
put them into excellent order. The fourth side of
the square was shut up by a screen wall, through
which a door opened to the avenue; the whole
being a kind of structure, which may be still found
on those old Scottish properties, where a rage to
render their place <i>Parkish</i>, as was at one time the
prevailing phrase, has not induced the owners to
pull down the venerable and sheltering appendages
with which their wiser fathers had screened their
mansion, and to lay the whole open to the keen
north-east; much after the fashion of a spinster of
fifty, who chills herself to gratify the public by an
exposure of her thin red elbows, and shrivelled
neck and bosom.</p>

<p>A double door, thrown hospitably open on the
present occasion, admitted the company into a dark<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_14" id="vol_ii_Page_14">[Pg&nbsp;14]</a></span>
and low hall, where Mowbray himself, wearing the
under dress of Theseus, but not having yet assumed
his ducal cap and robes, stood to receive his guests
with due courtesy, and to indicate to each the road
allotted to him. Those who were to take a share in
the representation of the morning, were conducted
to an old saloon, destined for a green-room, and
which communicated with a series of apartments
on the right, hastily fitted with accommodations
for arranging and completing their toilet; while
others, who took no part in the intended drama,
were ushered to the left, into a large, unfurnished,
and long disused dining parlour, where a sashed
door opened into the gardens, crossed with yew and
holly hedges, still trimmed and clipped by the old
grey-headed gardener, upon those principles which a
Dutchman thought worthy of commemorating in a
didactic poem upon the <i>Ars Topiaria</i>.</p>

<p>A little wilderness, surrounding a beautiful piece
of the smoothest turf, and itself bounded by such
high hedges as we have described, had been selected
as the stage most proper for the exhibition of
the intended dramatic picture. It afforded many
facilities; for a rising bank exactly in front was
accommodated with seats for the spectators, who
had a complete view of the silvan theatre, the bushes
and shrubs having been cleared away, and the place
supplied with a temporary screen, which, being
withdrawn by the domestics appointed for that
purpose, was to serve for the rising of the curtain.
A covered trellis, which passed through another
part of the garden, and terminated with a private
door opening from the right wing of the building,
seemed as if it had been planted on purpose for the
proposed exhibition, as it served to give the person<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_15" id="vol_ii_Page_15">[Pg&nbsp;15]</a></span>ages
of the drama a convenient and secret access
from the green-room to the place of representation.
Indeed, the dramatis person&aelig;, at least those who
adopted the management of the matter, were
induced, by so much convenience, to extend, in
some measure, their original plan; and, instead of
one group, as had been at first proposed, they now
found themselves able to exhibit to the good company
a succession of three or four, selected and
arranged from different parts of the drama; thus
giving some duration, as well as some variety, to the
entertainment, besides the advantage of separating
and contrasting the tragic and the comic scenes.</p>

<p>After wandering about amongst the gardens,
which contained little to interest any one, and
endeavouring to recognise some characters, who,
accommodating themselves to the humours of the
day, had ventured to appear in the various disguises
of ballad-singers, pedlars, shepherds, Highlanders,
and so forth, the company began to draw together
towards the spot where the seats prepared for
them, and the screen drawn in front of the bosky
stage, induced them to assemble, and excited expectation,
especially as a scroll in front of the esplanade
set forth, in the words of the play, &ldquo;This
green plot shall be our stage, this hawthorn brake
our tiring-house, and we will do it in action.&rdquo; A
delay of about ten minutes began to excite some
suppressed murmurs of impatience among the audience,
when the touch of Gow's fiddle suddenly burst
from a neighbouring hedge, behind which he had
established his little orchestra. All were of course
silent,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;As through his dear strathspeys he bore with Highland rage.&rdquo;<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_16" id="vol_ii_Page_16">[Pg&nbsp;16]</a></span></div></div>

<p>And when he changed his strain to an adagio,
and suffered his music to die away in the plaintive
notes of Roslin Castle, the echoes of the old walls
were, after a long slumber, awakened by that enthusiastic
burst of applause, with which the Scots
usually received and rewarded their country's gifted
minstrel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is his father's own son,&rdquo; said Touchwood to
the clergyman, for both had gotten seats near about
the centre of the place of audience. &ldquo;It is many
a long year since I listened to old Neil at Inver,
and, to say truth, spent a night with him over
pancakes and Athole brose; and I never expected to
hear his match again in my lifetime. But stop&mdash;the
curtain rises.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The screen was indeed withdrawn, and displayed
Hermia, Helena, and their lovers, in attitudes
corresponding to the scene of confusion occasioned
by the error of Puck.</p>

<p>Messrs. Chatterly and the Painter played their
parts neither better nor worse than amateur actors
in general; and the best that could be said of them
was, that they seemed more than half ashamed of
their exotic dresses, and of the public gaze.</p>

<p>But against this untimely weakness Lady Penelope
was guarded, by the strong shield of self-conceit.
She minced, ambled, and, notwithstanding the
slight appearance of her person, and the depredations
which time had made on a countenance that
had never been very much distinguished for beauty,
seemed desirous to top the part of the beautiful
daughter of Egeus. The sullenness which was proper
to the character of Hermia, was much augmented
by the discovery that Miss Mowbray was so
much better dressed than herself,&mdash;a discovery<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_17" id="vol_ii_Page_17">[Pg&nbsp;17]</a></span>
which she had but recently made, as that young
lady had not attended on the regular rehearsals at
the Well, but once, and then without her stage
habit. Her ladyship, however, did not permit this
painful sense of inferiority, where she had expected
triumph, so far to prevail over her desire of shining,
as to interrupt materially the manner in which she
had settled to represent her portion of the scene.
The nature of the exhibition precluded much
action, but Lady Penelope made amends by such a
succession of grimaces, as might rival, in variety at
least, the singular display which Garrick used to
call &ldquo;going his rounds.&rdquo; She twisted her poor
features into looks of most desperate love towards
Lysander; into those of wonder and offended pride,
when she turned them upon Demetrius; and finally
settled them on Helena, with the happiest possible
imitation of an incensed rival, who feels the impossibility
of relieving her swollen heart by tears alone,
and is just about to have recourse to her nails.</p>

<p>No contrast could be stronger in looks, demeanour,
and figure, than that between Hermia and
Helena. In the latter character, the beautiful form
and foreign dress of Miss Mowbray attracted all
eyes. She kept her place on the stage, as a sentinel
does that which his charge assigns him; for she
had previously told her brother, that though she
consented, at his importunity, to make part of the
exhibition, it was as a piece of the scene, not as an
actor, and accordingly a painted figure could scarce be
more immovable. The expression of her countenance
seemed to be that of deep sorrow and perplexity,
belonging to her part, over which wandered at
times an air of irony or ridicule, as if she were
secretly scorning the whole exhibition, and even<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_18" id="vol_ii_Page_18">[Pg&nbsp;18]</a></span>
herself for condescending to become part of it.
Above all, a sense of bashfulness had cast upon her
cheek a colour, which, though sufficiently slight,
was more than her countenance was used to display;
and when the spectators beheld, in the splendour
and grace of a rich Oriental dress, her whom they
had hitherto been accustomed to see attired only in
the most careless manner, they felt the additional
charms of surprise and contrast; so that the bursts
of applause which were vollied towards the stage,
might be said to be addressed to her alone, and to vie
in sincerity with those which have been forced from
an audience by the most accomplished performer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, that puir Lady Penelope!&rdquo; said honest
Mrs. Blower, who, when her scruples against the
exhibition were once got over, began to look upon
it with particular interest,&mdash;&ldquo;I am really sorry for
her puir face, for she gars it work like the sails of
John Blower's vesshel in a stiff breeze.&mdash;Oh, Doctor
Cacklehen, dinna ye think she wad need, if it
were possible, to rin ower her face wi' a gusing iron,
just to take the wrunkles out o't?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush, hush! my good dear Mrs. Blower,&rdquo; said
the Doctor; &ldquo;Lady Penelope is a woman of quality,
and my patient, and such people always act charmingly&mdash;you
must understand there is no hissing at
a private theatre&mdash;Hem!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye may say what ye like, Doctor, but there
is nae fule like an auld fule&mdash;To be sure, if she was
as young and beautiful as Miss Mowbray&mdash;hegh
me, and I didna use to think her sae bonny neither&mdash;but
dress&mdash;dress makes an unco difference&mdash;That
shawl o' hers&mdash;I daur say the like o't was
ne'er seen in braid Scotland&mdash;It will be real Indian,
I'se warrant.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_19" id="vol_ii_Page_19">[Pg&nbsp;19]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Real Indian!&rdquo; said Mr. Touchwood, in an
accent of disdain, which rather disturbed Mrs.
Blower's equanimity,&mdash;&ldquo;why, what do you suppose
it should be, madam?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I dinna ken, sir,&rdquo; said she, edging somewhat
nearer the Doctor, not being altogether pleased, as
she afterwards allowed, with the outlandish appearance
and sharp tone of the traveller; then pulling
her own drapery round her shoulders, she added,
courageously, &ldquo;There are braw shawls made at
Paisley, that ye will scarce ken frae foreign.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not know Paisley shawls from Indian, madam?&rdquo;
said Touchwood; &ldquo;why, a blind man could tell by
the slightest touch of his little finger. Yon shawl,
now, is the handsomest I have seen in Britain&mdash;and
at this distance I can tell it to be a real
<i>Tozie</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cozie may she weel be that wears it,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Blower. &ldquo;I declare, now I look on't again, it's a
perfect beauty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is called Tozie, ma'am, not cozie,&rdquo; continued
the traveller; &ldquo;the Shroffs at Surat told me in 1801,
that it is made out of the inner coat of a goat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of a sheep, sir, I am thinking ye mean, for goats
has nae woo'.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not much of it, indeed, madam, but you are to
understand they use only the inmost coat; and then
their dyes&mdash;that Tozie now will keep its colour
while there is a rag of it left&mdash;men bequeath
them in legacies to their grandchildren.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And a very bonny colour it is,&rdquo; said the dame;
&ldquo;something like a mouse's back, only a thought
redder&mdash;I wonder what they ca' that colour.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The colour is much admired, madam,&rdquo; said
Touchwood, who was now on a favourite topic;<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_20" id="vol_ii_Page_20">[Pg&nbsp;20]</a></span>
&ldquo;the Mussulmans say the colour is betwixt that of
an elephant and the breast of the <i>faughta</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In troth, I am as wise as I was,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Blower.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The <i>faughta</i>, madam, so called by the Moors,
(for the Hindhus call it <i>hollah</i>,) is a sort of pigeon,
held sacred among the Moslem of India, because
they think it dyed its breast in the blood of Ali.&mdash;But
I see they are closing the scene.&mdash;Mr. Cargill,
are you composing your sermon, my good friend, or
what can you be thinking of?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Cargill had, during the whole scene, remained
with his eyes fixed, in intent and anxious, although
almost unconscious gaze, upon Clara Mowbray; and
when the voice of his companion startled him out of
his reverie, he exclaimed, &ldquo;Most lovely&mdash;most
unhappy&mdash;yes&mdash;I must and will see her!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;See her?&rdquo; replied Touchwood, too much accustomed
to his friend's singularities to look for much
reason or connexion in any thing he said or did;
&ldquo;Why, you shall see her and talk to her too, if that
will give you pleasure.&mdash;They say now,&rdquo; he continued,
lowering his voice to a whisper, &ldquo;that this
Mowbray is ruined. I see nothing like it, since he
can dress out his sister like a Begum. Did you
ever see such a splendid shawl?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dearly purchased splendour,&rdquo; said Mr. Cargill,
with a deep sigh; &ldquo;I wish that the price be yet
fully paid!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very likely not,&rdquo; said the traveller; &ldquo;very likely
it's gone to the book; and for the price, I have
known a thousand rupees given for such a shawl in
the country.&mdash;But hush, hush, we are to have
another tune from Nathaniel&mdash;faith, and they are
withdrawing the screen&mdash;Well, they have some<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_21" id="vol_ii_Page_21">[Pg&nbsp;21]</a></span>
mercy&mdash;they do not let us wait long between the
acts of their follies at least&mdash;I love a quick and
rattling fire in these vanities&mdash;Folly walking a
funeral pace, and clinking her bells to the time of a
passing knell, makes sad work indeed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A strain of music, beginning slowly, and terminating
in a light and wild allegro, introduced on the
stage those delightful creatures of the richest imagination
that ever teemed with wonders, the Oberon
and Titania of Shakspeare. The pigmy majesty of
the captain of the fairy band had no unapt representative
in Miss Digges, whose modesty was not
so great an intruder as to prevent her desire to
present him in all his dignity, and she moved, conscious
of the graceful turn of a pretty ankle, which,
encircled with a string of pearls, and clothed in
flesh-coloured silk, of the most cobweb texture, rose
above the crimson sandal. Her jewelled tiara, too,
gave dignity to the frown with which the offended
King of Shadows greeted his consort, as each entered
upon the scene at the head of their several
attendants.</p>

<p>The restlessness of the children had been duly
considered; and, therefore, their part of the exhibition
had been contrived to represent dumb show,
rather than a stationary picture. The little Queen
of Elves was not inferior in action to her moody
lord, and repaid, with a look of female impatience
and scorn, the haughty air which seemed to express
his sullen greeting,</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ill met by moonlight, proud Titania.&rdquo;<br />
</p>

<p>The other children were, as usual, some clever and
forward, some loutish and awkward enough; but
the gambols of childhood are sure to receive<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_22" id="vol_ii_Page_22">[Pg&nbsp;22]</a></span>
applause, paid, perhaps, with a mixture of pity and
envy, by those in advanced life; and besides, there
were in the company several fond papas and mammas,
whose clamorous approbation, though given
apparently to the whole performers, was especially
dedicated in their hearts to their own little Jackies
and Marias,&mdash;for <i>Mary</i>, though the prettiest and
most classical of Scottish names, is now unknown
in the land. The elves, therefore, played their
frolics, danced a measure, and vanished with good
approbation.</p>

<p>The anti-mask, as it may be called, of Bottom,
and his company of actors, next appeared on the
stage, and a thunder of applause received the young
Earl, who had, with infinite taste and dexterity,
transformed himself into the similitude of an Athenian
clown; observing the Grecian costume, yet so
judiciously discriminated from the dress of the
higher characters, as at once to fix the character of
a thick-skinned mechanic on the wearer. Touchwood,
in particular, was loud in his approbation,
from which the correctness of the costume must be
inferred; for that honest gentleman, like many other
critics, was indeed not very much distinguished for
good taste, but had a capital memory for petty matters
of fact; and, while the most impressive look
or gesture of an actor might have failed to interest
him, would have censured most severely the fashion
of a sleeve, or the colour of a shoe-tie.</p>

<p>But the Earl of Etherington's merits were not
confined to his external appearance; for, had his
better fortunes failed him, his deserts, like those of
Hamlet, might have got him a fellowship in a cry
of players. He presented, though in dumb show,
the pragmatic conceit of Bottom, to the infinite<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_23" id="vol_ii_Page_23">[Pg&nbsp;23]</a></span>
amusement of all present, especially of those who
were well acquainted with the original; and when he
was &ldquo;translated&rdquo; by Puck, he bore the ass's head,
his newly-acquired dignity, with an appearance of
conscious greatness, which made the metamorphosis,
though in itself sufficiently farcical, irresistibly
comic. He afterwards displayed the same humour
in his frolics with the fairies, and the intercourse
which he held with Messrs. Cobweb, Mustard-seed,
Pease-blossom, and the rest of Titania's cavaliers,
who lost all command of their countenances at the
gravity with which he invited them to afford him
the luxury of scratching his hairy snout. Mowbray
had also found a fitting representative for Puck in a
queer-looking, small-eyed boy of the Aultoun of St.
Ronan's, with large ears projecting from his head
like turrets from a Gothic building. This exotic
animal personified the merry and mocking spirit of
Hobgoblin with considerable power, so that the
group bore some resemblance to the well-known
and exquisite delineation of Puck by Sir Joshua, in
the select collection of the Bard of Memory. It
was, however, the ruin of the St. Ronan's Robin
Goodfellow, who did no good afterwards,&mdash;&ldquo;gaed
an ill gate,&rdquo; as Meg Dods said, and &ldquo;took on&rdquo; with
a party of strolling players.</p>

<p>The entertainment closed with a grand parade
of all the characters that had appeared, during
which Mowbray concluded that the young lord
himself, unremarked, might have time enough to
examine the outward form, at least, of his sister
Clara, whom, in the pride of his heart, he could
not help considering superior in beauty, dressed as
she now was, with every advantage of art, even to
the brilliant Amazon, Lady Binks. It is true,<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_24" id="vol_ii_Page_24">[Pg&nbsp;24]</a></span>
Mowbray was not a man to give preference to the
intellectual expression of poor Clara's features over
the sultana-like beauty of the haughty dame, which
promised to an admirer all the vicissitudes that
can be expressed by a countenance lovely in every
change, and changing as often as an ardent and
impetuous disposition, unused to constraint, and
despising admonition, should please to dictate.
Yet, to do him justice, though his preference was
perhaps dictated more by fraternal partiality than
by purity of taste, he certainly, on the present occasion,
felt the full extent of Clara's superiority; and
there was a proud smile on his lip, as, at the conclusion
of the divertisement, he asked the Earl how
he had been pleased. The rest of the performers
had separated, and the young lord remained on the
stage, employed in disembarrassing himself of his
awkward visor, when Mowbray put this question,
to which, though general in terms, he naturally
gave a particular meaning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I could wear my ass's head for ever,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;on condition my eyes were to be so delightfully
employed as they have been during the last scene.&mdash;Mowbray,
your sister is an angel!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have a care that that headpiece of yours has
not perverted your taste, my lord,&rdquo; said Mowbray.
&ldquo;But why did you wear that disguise on your last
appearance? You should, I think, have been
uncovered.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am ashamed to answer you,&rdquo; said the Earl;
&ldquo;but truth is, first impressions are of consequence,
and I thought I might do as wisely not to appear
before your sister, for the first time, in the character
of Bully Bottom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you change your dress, my lord, for<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_25" id="vol_ii_Page_25">[Pg&nbsp;25]</a></span>
dinner, if we call our luncheon by that name?&rdquo;
said Mowbray.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am going to my room this instant for that
very purpose,&rdquo; replied the Earl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I,&rdquo; said Mowbray, &ldquo;must step in front,
and dismiss the audience; for I see they are sitting
gaping there, waiting for another scene.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They parted upon this; and Mowbray, as Duke
Theseus, stepped before the screen, and announcing
the conclusion of the dramatic pictures which they
had had the honour to present before the worshipful
company, thanked the spectators for the very
favourable reception which they had afforded; and
intimated to them, that if they could amuse themselves
by strolling for an hour among the gardens,
a bell would summon to the house at the expiry of
that time, when some refreshments would wait
their acceptance. This annunciation was received
with the applause due to the <i>Amphitryon ou l'on
dine</i>; and the guests, arising from before the temporary
theatre, dispersed through the gardens, which
were of some extent, to seek for or create amusement
to themselves. The music greatly aided them in
this last purpose, and it was not long ere a dozen
of couples and upwards, were &ldquo;tripping it on the
light fantastic toe,&rdquo; (I love a phrase that is not
hackneyed,) to the tune of Monymusk.</p>

<p>Others strolled through the grounds, meeting
some quaint disguise at the end of every verdant
alley, and communicating to others the surprise
and amusement which they themselves were receiving.
The scene, from the variety of dresses, the
freedom which it gave to the display of humour
amongst such as possessed any, and the general
disposition to give and receive pleasure, rendered<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_26" id="vol_ii_Page_26">[Pg&nbsp;26]</a></span>
the little masquerade more entertaining than others
of the kind for which more ample and magnificent
preparations have been made. There was also a
singular and pleasing contrast between the fantastic
figures who wandered through the gardens,
and the quiet scene itself, to which the old clipt
hedges, the formal distribution of the ground, and
the antiquated appearance of one or two fountains
and artificial cascades, in which the naiads had
been for the nonce compelled to resume their
ancient frolics, gave an appearance of unusual simplicity
and seclusion, and which seemed rather to
belong to the last than to the present generation.<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_27" id="vol_ii_Page_27">[Pg&nbsp;27]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Touchwood, and his inseparable friend, Mr.
Cargill, wandered on amidst the gay groups
we have described, the former censuring with
great scorn the frequent attempts which he
observed towards an imitation of the costume
of the East, and appealing with self-complacence
to his own superior representation, as he greeted,
in Moorish and in Persic, the several turban'd
figures who passed his way; while the clergyman,
whose mind seemed to labour with some weighty
and important project, looked in every direction
for the fair representative of Helena, but in vain.
At length he caught a glimpse of the memorable
shawl, which had drawn forth so learned a discussion
from his companion; and, starting from
Touchwood's side with a degree of anxious alertness
totally foreign to his usual habits, he endeavoured
to join the person by whom it was worn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By the Lord,&rdquo; said his companion, &ldquo;the Doctor
is beside himself!&mdash;the parson is mad!&mdash;the
divine is out of his senses, that is clear; and how<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_28" id="vol_ii_Page_28">[Pg&nbsp;28]</a></span>
the devil can he, who scarce can find his road
from the Cleikum to his own manse, venture
himself unprotected into such a scene of confusion?&mdash;he
might as well pretend to cross the
Atlantic without a pilot&mdash;I must push off in
chase of him, lest worse come of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the traveller was prevented from executing
his friendly purpose by a sort of crowd which came
rushing down the alley, the centre of which was
occupied by Captain MacTurk, in the very act
of bullying two pseudo Highlanders, for having
presumed to lay aside their breeches before they
had acquired the Gaelic language. The sounds
of contempt and insult with which the genuine
Celt was overwhelming the unfortunate impostors,
were not, indeed, intelligible otherwise than from
the tone and manner of the speaker; but these
intimated so much displeasure, that the plaided
forms whose unadvised choice of a disguise had
provoked it&mdash;two raw lads from a certain great
manufacturing town&mdash;heartily repented their
temerity, and were in the act of seeking for the
speediest exit from the gardens; rather choosing
to resign their share of the dinner, than to abide
the farther consequences that might follow from
the displeasure of this highland Termagant.</p>

<p>Touchwood had scarcely extricated himself from
this impediment, and again commenced his
researches after the clergyman, when his course
was once more interrupted by a sort of pressgang,
headed by Sir Bingo Binks, who, in order to play
his character of a drunken boatswain to the life,
seemed certainly drunk enough, however little of
a seaman. His cheer sounded more like a view-hollo
than a hail, when, with a volley of such oaths<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_29" id="vol_ii_Page_29">[Pg&nbsp;29]</a></span>
as would have blown a whole fleet of the Bethel
Union out of the water, he ordered Touchwood &ldquo;to
come under his lee, and be d&mdash;&mdash;d; for, smash his
old timbers, he must go to sea again, for as weather-beaten
a hulk as he was.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Touchwood answered instantly, &ldquo;To sea with
all my heart, but not with a land-lubber for commander.&mdash;Harkye,
brother, do you know how
much of a horse's furniture belongs to a ship?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, none of your quizzing, my old buck,&rdquo;
said Sir Bingo&mdash;&ldquo;What the devil has a ship to
do with horse's furniture?&mdash;Do you think we
belong to the horse-marines?&mdash;ha! ha! I think
you're matched, brother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, you son of a fresh-water gudgeon,&rdquo;
replied the traveller, &ldquo;that never in your life
sailed farther than the Isle of Dogs, do you pretend
to play a sailor, and not know the bridle of the
bow-line, and the saddle of the boltsprit, and the
bit for the cable, and the girth to hoist the rigging,
and the whip to serve for small tackle?&mdash;There is
a trick for you to find out an Abram-man, and
save sixpence when he begs of you as a disbanded
seaman.&mdash;Get along with you! or the constable
shall be charged with the whole pressgang to man
the workhouse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A general laugh arose at the detection of the
swaggering boatswain; and all that the Baronet
had for it was to sneak off, saying, &ldquo;D&mdash;n the old
quiz, who the devil thought to have heard so much
slang from an old muslin nightcap!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Touchwood being now an object of some attention,
was followed by two or three stragglers, whom he
endeavoured to rid himself of the best way he
could, testifying an impatience a little inconsistent<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_30" id="vol_ii_Page_30">[Pg&nbsp;30]</a></span>
with the decorum of his Oriental demeanour, but
which arose from his desire to rejoin his companion,
and some apprehension of inconvenience which he
feared Cargill might sustain during his absence.
For, being in fact as good-natured a man as any
in the world, Mr. Touchwood was at the same time
one of the most conceited, and was very apt to
suppose, that his presence, advice, and assistance,
were of the most indispensable consequence to those
with whom he lived; and that not only on great
emergencies, but even in the most ordinary occurrences
of life.</p>

<p>Meantime, Mr. Cargill, whom he sought in vain,
was, on his part, anxiously keeping in sight of
the beautiful Indian shawl, which served as a flag
to announce to him the vessel which he held in
chase. At length he approached so close as to say,
in an anxious whisper, &ldquo;Miss Mowbray&mdash;Miss
Mowbray&mdash;I must speak with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what would you have with Miss Mowbray?&rdquo;
said the fair wearer of the beautiful shawl,
but without turning round her head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have a secret&mdash;an important secret, of which
to make you aware; but it is not for this place.&mdash;Do
not turn from me!&mdash;Your happiness in this,
and perhaps in the next life, depends on your
listening to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The lady led the way, as if to give him an opportunity
of speaking with her more privately, to
one of those old-fashioned and deeply-embowered
recesses, which are commonly found in such gardens
as that of Shaws-Castle; and, with her shawl
wrapped around her head, so as in some degree to
conceal her features, she stood before Mr. Cargill in
the doubtful light and shadow of a huge platanus<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_31" id="vol_ii_Page_31">[Pg&nbsp;31]</a></span>
tree, which formed the canopy of the arbour, and
seemed to await the communication he had
promised.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Report says,&rdquo; said the clergyman, speaking in
an eager and hurried manner, yet with a low voice,
and like one desirous of being heard by her whom
he addressed, and by no one else,&mdash;&ldquo;Report says
that you are about to be married.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And is report kind enough to say to whom?&rdquo;
answered the lady, with a tone of indifference which
seemed to astound her interrogator.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Young lady,&rdquo; he answered, with a solemn voice,
&ldquo;had this levity been sworn to me, I could never
have believed it! Have you forgot the circumstances
in which you stand?&mdash;Have you forgotten
that my promise of secrecy, sinful perhaps even in
that degree, was but a conditional promise?&mdash;or
did you think that a being so sequestered as I am
was already dead to the world, even while he was
walking upon its surface?&mdash;Know, young lady, that
I am indeed dead to the pleasures and the ordinary
business of life, but I am even therefore the more
alive to its duties.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Upon my honour, sir, unless you are pleased
to be more explicit, it is impossible for me either
to answer or understand you,&rdquo; said the lady; &ldquo;you
speak too seriously for a masquerade pleasantry,
and yet not clearly enough to make your earnest
comprehensible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is this sullenness, Miss Mowbray?&rdquo; said the
clergyman, with increased animation; &ldquo;Is it levity?&mdash;Or
is it alienation of mind?&mdash;Even after a fever
of the brain, we retain a recollection of the causes
of our illness.&mdash;Come, you must and do understand
me, when I say, that I will not consent to your<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_32" id="vol_ii_Page_32">[Pg&nbsp;32]</a></span>
committing a great crime to attain temporal wealth
and rank, no, not to make you an empress. My path
is a clear one; and should I hear a whisper breathed
of your alliance with this Earl, or whatever he may
be, rely upon it, that I will withdraw the veil, and
make your brother, your bridegroom, and the whole
world, acquainted with the situation in which you
stand, and the impossibility of your forming the
alliance which you propose to yourself, I am compelled
to say, against the laws of God and man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, sir&mdash;sir,&rdquo; answered the lady, rather eagerly
than anxiously, &ldquo;you have not yet told me what
business you have with my marriage, or what arguments
you can bring against it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; replied Mr. Cargill, &ldquo;in your present
state of mind, and in such a scene as this, I cannot
enter upon a topic for which the season is unfit, and
you, I am sorry to say, are totally unprepared. It
is enough that you know the grounds on which you
stand. At a fitter opportunity, I will, as it is my
duty, lay before you the enormity of what you are
said to have meditated, with the freedom which
becomes one, who, however humble, is appointed
to explain to his fellow-creatures the laws of his
Maker. In the meantime, I am not afraid that
you will take any hasty step, after such a warning
as this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So saying, he turned from the lady with that dignity
which a conscious discharge of duty confers,
yet, at the same time, with a sense of deep pain,
inflicted by the careless levity of her whom he
addressed. She did not any longer attempt to
detain him, but made her escape from the arbour by
one alley, as she heard voices which seemed to
approach it from another. The clergyman, who took<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_33" id="vol_ii_Page_33">[Pg&nbsp;33]</a></span>
the opposite direction, met in full encounter a whispering
and tittering pair, who seemed, at his sudden
appearance, to check their tone of familiarity, and
assume an appearance of greater distance towards
each other. The lady was no other than the fair
Queen of the Amazons, who seemed to have adopted
the recent partiality of Titania towards Bully Bottom,
being in conference such and so close as we
have described, with the late representative of the
Athenian weaver, whom his recent visit to his chamber
had metamorphosed into the more gallant
disguise of an ancient Spanish cavalier. He now
appeared with cloak and drooping plume, sword,
poniard, and guitar, richly dressed at all points, as
for a serenade beneath his mistress's window; a silk
mask at the breast of his embroidered doublet hung
ready to be assumed in case of intrusion, as an
appropriate part of the national dress.</p>

<p>It sometimes happened to Mr. Cargill, as we
believe it may chance to other men much subject to
absence of mind, that, contrary to their wont, and
much after the manner of a sunbeam suddenly
piercing a deep mist, and illuminating one particular
object in the landscape, some sudden recollection
rushes upon them, and seems to compel them to
act under it, as under the influence of complete
certainty and conviction. Mr. Cargill had no sooner
set eyes on the Spanish cavalier, in whom he neither
knew the Earl of Etherington, nor recognised Bully
Bottom, than with hasty emotion he seized on his
reluctant hand, and exclaimed, with a mixture of
eagerness and solemnity, &ldquo;I rejoice to see you!&mdash;Heaven
has sent you here in its own good time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thank you, sir,&rdquo; replied Lord Etherington,
very coldly, &ldquo;I believe you have the joy of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_34" id="vol_ii_Page_34">[Pg&nbsp;34]</a></span>
meeting entirely on your side, as I cannot remember
having seen you before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is not your name Bulmer?&rdquo; said the clergyman.
&ldquo;I&mdash;I know&mdash;I am sometimes apt to make
mistakes&mdash;But I am sure your name is Bulmer?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not that ever I or my godfathers heard of&mdash;my
name was Bottom half an hour ago&mdash;perhaps
that makes the confusion,&rdquo; answered the Earl, with
very cold and distant politeness;&mdash;&ldquo;Permit me to
pass, sir, that I may attend the lady.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quite unnecessary,&rdquo; answered Lady Binks; &ldquo;I
leave you to adjust your mutual recollections with
your new old friend, my lord&mdash;he seems to have
something to say.&rdquo; So saying, the lady walked on,
not perhaps sorry of an opportunity to show apparent
indifference for his lordship's society in the
presence of one who had surprised them in what
might seem a moment of exuberant intimacy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You detain me, sir,&rdquo; said the Earl of Etherington
to Mr. Cargill, who, bewildered and uncertain, still
kept himself placed so directly before the young
nobleman, as to make it impossible for him to pass,
without absolutely pushing him to one side. &ldquo;I
must really attend the lady,&rdquo; he added, making
another effort to walk on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Young man,&rdquo; said Mr. Cargill, &ldquo;you cannot disguise
yourself from me. I am sure&mdash;my mind
assures me, that you are that very Bulmer whom
Heaven hath sent here to prevent crime.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you,&rdquo; said Lord Etherington, &ldquo;whom my
mind assures me I never saw in my life, are sent
hither by the devil, I think, to create confusion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I beg pardon, sir,&rdquo; said the clergyman, staggered
by the calm and pertinacious denial of the Earl&mdash;&ldquo;I
beg pardon if I am in a mistake&mdash;that is, if I<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_35" id="vol_ii_Page_35">[Pg&nbsp;35]</a></span>
am <i>really</i> in a mistake&mdash;but I am not&mdash;I am sure
I am not!&mdash;That look&mdash;that smile&mdash;I am <span class="lowercase smcap">NOT</span>
mistaken. You <i>are</i> Valentine Bulmer&mdash;the very
Valentine Bulmer whom I&mdash;but I will not make
your private affairs any part of this exposition&mdash;enough,
you <i>are</i> Valentine Bulmer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Valentine?&mdash;Valentine?&rdquo; answered Lord Etherington,
impatiently,&mdash;&ldquo;I am neither Valentine nor
Orson&mdash;I wish you good-morning, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stay, sir, stay, I charge you,&rdquo; said the clergyman;
&ldquo;if you are unwilling to be known yourself, it
may be because you have forgotten who I am&mdash;Let
me name myself as the Reverend Josiah Cargill,
minister of St. Ronan's.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you bear a character so venerable, sir,&rdquo; replied
the young nobleman,&mdash;&ldquo;in which, however, I am
not in the least interested,&mdash;I think when you
make your morning draught a little too potent, it
might be as well for you to stay at home and sleep
it off, before coming into company.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the name of Heaven, young gentleman,&rdquo; said
Mr. Cargill, &ldquo;lay aside this untimely and unseemly
jesting! and tell me if you be not&mdash;as I cannot
but still believe you to be&mdash;that same youth, who,
seven years since, left in my deposit a solemn secret,
which, if I should unfold to the wrong person, woe
would be my own heart, and evil the consequences
which might ensue!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are very pressing with me, sir,&rdquo; said the
Earl; &ldquo;and, in exchange, I will be equally frank
with you.&mdash;I am not the man whom you mistake me
for, and you may go seek him where you will&mdash;It will
be still more lucky for you if you chance to find your
own wits in the course of your researches; for I
must tell you plainly, I think they are gone some<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_36" id="vol_ii_Page_36">[Pg&nbsp;36]</a></span>what
astray.&rdquo; So saying, with a gesture expressive
of a determined purpose to pass on, Mr. Cargill had
no alternative but to make way, and suffer him to
proceed.</p>

<p>The worthy clergyman stood as if rooted to the
ground, and, with his usual habit of thinking aloud
exclaimed to himself, &ldquo;My fancy has played me
many a bewildering trick, but this is the most
extraordinary of them all!&mdash;What can this young
man think of me? It must have been my conversation
with that unhappy young lady that has made
such an impression upon me as to deceive my very
eyesight, and causes me to connect with her history
the face of the next person that I met&mdash;What
<i>must</i> the stranger think of me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, what every one thinks of thee that knows
thee, prophet,&rdquo; said the friendly voice of Touchwood,
accompanying his speech with an awakening slap on
the clergyman's shoulder; &ldquo;and that is, that thou
art an unfortunate philosopher of Laputa, who has
lost his flapper in the throng.&mdash;Come along&mdash;having
me once more by your side, you need fear
nothing. Why, now I look at you closer, you look as
if you had seen a basilisk&mdash;not that there is any such
thing, otherwise I must have seen it myself, in the
course of my travels&mdash;but you seem pale and frightened&mdash;What
the devil is the matter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; answered the clergyman, &ldquo;except
that I have even this very moment made an egregious
fool of myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pooh, pooh, that is nothing to sigh over, prophet.&mdash;Every
man does so at least twice in the four-and-twenty
hours,&rdquo; said Touchwood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I had nearly betrayed to a stranger, a secret
deeply concerning the honour of an ancient family.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_37" id="vol_ii_Page_37">[Pg&nbsp;37]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;That was wrong, Doctor,&rdquo; said Touchwood;
&ldquo;take care of that in future; and, indeed, I would
advise you not to speak even to your beadle, Johnie
Tirlsneck, until you have assured yourself, by at
least three pertinent questions and answers, that you
have the said Johnie corporeally and substantially
in presence before you, and that your fancy has not
invested some stranger with honest Johnie's singed
periwig and threadbare brown joseph&mdash;Come along&mdash;come
along.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So saying, he hurried forward the perplexed
clergyman, who in vain made all the excuses he
could think of in order to effect his escape from the
scene of gaiety, in which he was so unexpectedly
involved. He pleaded headache; and his friend
assured him that a mouthful of food, and a glass of
wine, would mend it. He stated he had business;
and Touchwood replied that he could have none but
composing his next sermon, and reminded him that
it was two days till Sunday. At length, Mr. Cargill
confessed that he had some reluctance again to see
the stranger, on whom he had endeavoured with
such pertinacity to fix an acquaintance, which he
was now well assured existed only in his own imagination.
The traveller treated his scruples with
scorn, and said, that guests meeting in this general
manner, had no more to do with each other than if
they were assembled in a caravansary.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So that you need not say a word to him in the
way of apology or otherwise&mdash;or, what will be still
better, I, who have seen so much of the world, will
make the pretty speech for you.&rdquo; As they spoke,
he dragged the divine towards the house, where
they were now summoned by the appointed signal,
and where the company were assembling in the old<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_38" id="vol_ii_Page_38">[Pg&nbsp;38]</a></span>
saloon already noticed, previous to passing into the
dining-room, where the refreshments were prepared.
&ldquo;Now, Doctor,&rdquo; continued the busy friend of Mr.
Cargill, &ldquo;let us see which of all these people has
been the subject of your blunder. Is it yon animal
of a Highlandman?&mdash;or the impertinent brute that
wants to be thought a boatswain?&mdash;or which of
them all is it?&mdash;Ay, here they come, two and two,
Newgate fashion&mdash;the young Lord of the Manor
with old Lady Penelope&mdash;does he set up for
Ulysses, I wonder?&mdash;The Earl of Etherington with
Lady Bingo&mdash;methinks it should have been with
Miss Mowbray.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Earl of what, did you say?&rdquo; quoth the
clergyman, anxiously. &ldquo;How is it you titled that
young man in the Spanish dress?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oho!&rdquo; said the traveller; &ldquo;what, I have discovered
the goblin that has scared you?&mdash;Come
along&mdash;come along&mdash;I will make you acquainted
with him.&rdquo; So saying, he dragged him towards
Lord Etherington; and before the divine could
make his negative intelligible, the ceremony of
introduction had taken place. &ldquo;My Lord Etherington,
allow me to present Mr. Cargill, minister of
this parish&mdash;a learned gentleman, whose head is
often in the Holy Land, when his person seems present
among his friends. He suffers extremely, my
lord, under the sense of mistaking your lordship for
the Lord knows who; but when you are acquainted
with him, you will find that he can make a hundred
stranger mistakes than that, so we hope that your
lordship will take no prejudice or offence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There can be no offence taken where no offence
is intended,&rdquo; said Lord Etherington, with much
urbanity. &ldquo;It is I who ought to beg the reverend<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_39" id="vol_ii_Page_39">[Pg&nbsp;39]</a></span>
gentleman's pardon, for hurrying from him without
allowing him to make a complete eclaircissement.
I beg his pardon for an abruptness which the place
and the time&mdash;for I was immediately engaged in a
lady's service&mdash;rendered unavoidable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Cargill gazed on the young nobleman as he
pronounced these words, with the easy indifference
of one who apologizes to an inferior in order to
maintain his own character for politeness, but with
perfect indifference whether his excuses are or are
not held satisfactory. And as the clergyman gazed,
the belief which had so strongly clung to him that
the Earl of Etherington and young Valentine Bulmer
were the same individual person, melted away
like frostwork before the morning sun, and that so
completely, that he marvelled at himself for having
ever entertained it. Some strong resemblance of
features there must have been to have led him into
such a delusion; but the person, the tone, the
manner of expression, were absolutely different; and
his attention being now especially directed towards
these particulars, Mr. Cargill was inclined to think
the two personages almost totally dissimilar.</p>

<p>The clergyman had now only to make his apology,
and fall back from the head of the table to
some lower seat, which his modesty would have preferred,
when he was suddenly seized upon by the
Lady Penelope Penfeather, who, detaining him in
the most elegant and persuasive manner possible,
insisted that they should be introduced to each other
by Mr. Mowbray, and that Mr. Cargill should
sit beside her at table.&mdash;She had heard so much of
his learning&mdash;so much of his excellent character&mdash;desired
so much to make his acquaintance, that she
could not think of losing an opportunity, which Mr.<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_40" id="vol_ii_Page_40">[Pg&nbsp;40]</a></span>
Cargill's learned seclusion rendered so very rare&mdash;in
a word, catching the Black Lion was the order
of the day; and her ladyship having trapped her
prey, soon sat triumphant with him by her side.</p>

<p>A second separation was thus effected betwixt
Touchwood and his friend; for the former, not
being included in the invitation, or, indeed, at all
noticed by Lady Penelope, was obliged to find room
at a lower part of the table, where he excited much
surprise by the dexterity with which he dispatched
boiled rice with chop-sticks.</p>

<p>Mr. Cargill being thus exposed, without a consort,
to the fire of Lady Penelope, speedily found it
so brisk and incessant, as to drive his complaisance,
little tried as it had been for many years by small
talk, almost to extremity. She began by begging
him to draw his chair close, for an instinctive terror
of fine ladies had made him keep his distance.
At the same time, she hoped &ldquo;he was not afraid of
her as an Episcopalian; her father had belonged to
that communion; for,&rdquo; she added, with what was
intended for an arch smile, &ldquo;we were somewhat
naughty in the forty-five, as you may have heard;
but all that was over, and she was sure Mr. Cargill
was too liberal to entertain any dislike or shyness
on that score.&mdash;She could assure him she was far
from disliking the Presbyterian form&mdash;indeed she
had often wished to hear it, where she was sure
to be both delighted and edified&rdquo; (here a gracious
smile) &ldquo;in the church of St. Ronan's&mdash;and hoped
to do so whenever Mr. Mowbray had got a stove,
which he had ordered from Edinburgh, on purpose
to air his pew for her accommodation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>All this, which was spoken with wreathed smiles
and nods, and so much civility as to remind the<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_41" id="vol_ii_Page_41">[Pg&nbsp;41]</a></span>
clergyman of a cup of tea over-sweetened to conceal
its want of strength, and flavour, required and
received no farther answer than an accommodating
look and acquiescent bow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, Mr. Cargill,&rdquo; continued the inexhaustible
Lady Penelope, &ldquo;your profession has so many
demands on the heart as well as the understanding&mdash;is
so much connected with the kindnesses and
charities of our nature&mdash;with our best and purest
feelings, Mr. Cargill! You know what Goldsmith
says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&mdash;&mdash;&lsquo;to his duty prompt at every call,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He watch'd, and wept, and felt, and pray'd for all.&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And then Dryden has such a picture of a parish
priest, so inimitable, one would think, did we not
hear now and then of some living mortal presuming
to emulate its features,&rdquo; (here another insinuating
nod and expressive smile.)</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;&lsquo;Refined himself to soul to curb the sense,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And almost made a sin of abstinence.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet had his aspect nothing of severe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But such a face as promised him sincere;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nothing reserved or sullen was to see,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But sweet regard and pleasing sanctity.&rsquo;&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>While her ladyship declaimed, the clergyman's
wandering eye confessed his absent mind; his
thoughts travelling, perhaps, to accomplish a truce
betwixt Saladin and Conrade of Mountserrat, unless
they chanced to be occupied with some occurrences
of that very day, so that the lady was obliged to
recall her indocile auditor with the leading question,
&ldquo;You are well acquainted with Dryden, of
course, Mr. Cargill?&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_42" id="vol_ii_Page_42">[Pg&nbsp;42]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I have not the honour, madam,&rdquo; said Mr. Cargill,
starting from his reverie, and but half understanding
the question he replied to.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir!&rdquo; said the lady in surprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Madam!&mdash;my lady!&rdquo; answered Mr. Cargill, in
embarrassment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I asked you if you admired Dryden;&mdash;but you
learned men are so absent&mdash;perhaps you thought I
said Leyden.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A lamp too early quenched, madam,&rdquo; said Mr
Cargill; &ldquo;I knew him well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And so did I,&rdquo; eagerly replied the lady of the
cerulean buskin; &ldquo;he spoke ten languages&mdash;how
mortifying to poor me, Mr. Cargill, who could only
boast of five!&mdash;but I have studied a little since
that time&mdash;I must have you to help me in my
studies, Mr. Cargill&mdash;it will be charitable&mdash;but
perhaps you are afraid of a female pupil?&rdquo;</p>

<p>A thrill, arising from former recollections, passed
through poor Cargill's mind, with as much acuteness
as the pass of a rapier might have done through his
body; and we cannot help remarking, that a forward
prater in society, like a busy bustler in a crowd,
besides all other general points of annoyance, is
eternally rubbing upon some tender point, and
galling men's feelings, without knowing or regarding
it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must assist me, besides, in my little charities,
Mr. Cargill, now that you and I are become
so well acquainted.&mdash;There is that Anne Heggie&mdash;I
sent her a trifle yesterday, but I am told&mdash;I
should not mention it, but only one would not have
the little they have to bestow lavished on an improper
object&mdash;I am told she is not quite proper&mdash;an
unwedded mother, in short, Mr. Cargill&mdash;and<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_43" id="vol_ii_Page_43">[Pg&nbsp;43]</a></span>
it would be especially unbecoming in me to encourage
profligacy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe, madam,&rdquo; said the clergyman, gravely,
&ldquo;the poor woman's distress may justify your ladyship's
bounty, even if her conduct has been faulty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, I am no prude, neither, I assure you, Mr.
Cargill,&rdquo; answered the Lady Penelope. &ldquo;I never
withdraw my countenance from any one but on the
most irrefragable grounds. I could tell you of an
intimate friend of my own, whom I have supported
against the whole clamour of the people at the
Well, because I believe, from the bottom of my
soul, she is only thoughtless&mdash;nothing in the world
but thoughtless&mdash;O Mr. Cargill, how can you look
across the table so intelligently?&mdash;who would have
thought it of you?&mdash;Oh fie, to make such personal
applications!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Upon my word, madam, I am quite at a loss to
comprehend&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh fie, fie, Mr. Cargill,&rdquo; throwing in as much
censure and surprise as a confidential whisper can
convey&mdash;&ldquo;you looked at my Lady Binks&mdash;I know
what you think, but you are quite wrong, I assure
you; you are entirely wrong.&mdash;I wish she would
not flirt quite so much with that young Lord
Etherington though, Mr. Cargill&mdash;her situation is
particular.&mdash;Indeed, I believe she wears out his
patience; for see he is leaving the room before we
sit down&mdash;how singular!&mdash;And then, do you not
think it very odd, too, that Miss Mowbray has not
come down to us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Mowbray!&mdash;what of Miss Mowbray&mdash;is
she not here?&rdquo; said Mr. Cargill, starting, and with an
expression of interest which he had not yet bestowed
on any of her ladyship's liberal communications.<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_44" id="vol_ii_Page_44">[Pg&nbsp;44]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, poor Miss Mowbray,&rdquo; said Lady Penelope,
lowering her voice, and shaking her head; &ldquo;she has
not appeared&mdash;her brother went up stairs a few
minutes since, I believe, to bring her down, and so we
are all left here to look at each other.&mdash;How very
awkward!&mdash;But you know Clara Mowbray.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I, madam?&rdquo; said Mr. Cargill, who was now
sufficiently attentive; &ldquo;I really&mdash;I know Miss
Mowbray&mdash;that is, I knew her some years since&mdash;but
your ladyship knows she has been long in
bad health&mdash;uncertain health at least, and I have
seen nothing of the young lady for a very long
time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know it, my dear Mr. Cargill&mdash;I know it,&rdquo;
continued the Lady Penelope, in the same tone of
deep sympathy, &ldquo;I know it; and most unhappy
surely have been the circumstances that have separated
her from your advice and friendly counsel.&mdash;All
this I am aware of&mdash;and to say truth, it has
been chiefly on poor Clara's account that I have
been giving you the trouble of fixing an acquaintance
upon you.&mdash;You and I together, Mr. Cargill,
might do wonders to cure her unhappy state of mind&mdash;I
am sure we might&mdash;that is, if you could bring
your mind to repose absolute confidence in me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Has Miss Mowbray desired your ladyship to
converse with me upon any subject which interests
her?&rdquo; said the clergyman, with more cautious
shrewdness than Lady Penelope had suspected him
of possessing. &ldquo;I will in that case be happy to
hear the nature of her communication; and whatever
my poor services can perform, your ladyship
may command them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;I cannot just assert,&rdquo; said her ladyship
with hesitation, &ldquo;that I have Miss Mowbray's direct<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_45" id="vol_ii_Page_45">[Pg&nbsp;45]</a></span>
instructions to speak to you, Mr. Cargill, upon the
present subject. But my affection for the dear girl
is so very great&mdash;and then, you know, the inconveniences
which may arise from this match.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;From which match, Lady Penelope?&rdquo; said Mr.
Cargill.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, now, Mr. Cargill, you really carry the
privilege of Scotland too far&mdash;I have not put a
single question to you, but what you have answered
by another&mdash;let us converse intelligibly for five
minutes, if you can but condescend so far.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For any length of time which your ladyship
may please to command,&rdquo; said Mr. Cargill, &ldquo;provided
the subject regard your ladyship's own affairs
or mine,&mdash;could I suppose these last for a moment
likely to interest you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Out upon you,&rdquo; said the lady, laughing affectedly;
&ldquo;you should really have been a Catholic priest
instead of a Presbyterian. What an invaluable
father confessor have the fair sex lost in you,
Mr. Cargill, and how dexterously you would have
evaded any cross-examinations which might have
committed your penitents!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your ladyship's raillery is far too severe for me
to withstand or reply to,&rdquo; said Mr. Cargill, bowing
with more ease than her ladyship expected; and,
retiring gently backward, he extricated himself
from a conversation which he began to find somewhat
embarrassing.</p>

<p>At that moment a murmur of surprise took place
in the apartment, which was just entered by Miss
Mowbray, leaning on her brother's arm. The cause
of this murmur will be best understood, by narrating
what had passed betwixt the brother and sister.<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_46" id="vol_ii_Page_46">[Pg&nbsp;46]</a></span></p>

<i>The Taming of the Shrew.</i><br />
</p>


<p>It was with a mixture of anxiety, vexation, and
resentment, that Mowbray, just when he had handed
Lady Penelope into the apartment where the tables
were covered, observed that his sister was absent,
and that Lady Binks was hanging on the arm of
Lord Etherington, to whose rank it would properly
have fallen to escort the lady of the house. An
anxious and hasty glance cast through the room,
ascertained that she was absent, nor could the
ladies present give any account of her after she had
quitted the gardens, except that Lady Penelope
had spoken a few words with her in her own apartment,
immediately after the scenic entertainment was
concluded.</p>

<p>Thither Mowbray hurried, complaining aloud of
his sister's laziness in dressing, but internally hoping
that the delay was occasioned by nothing of a
more important character.</p>

<p>He hastened up stairs, entered her sitting-room
without ceremony, and knocking at the door of her
dressing-room, begged her to make haste.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here is the whole company impatient,&rdquo; he said,
assuming a tone of pleasantry; &ldquo;and Sir Bingo<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_47" id="vol_ii_Page_47">[Pg&nbsp;47]</a></span>
Binks exclaiming for your presence, that he may
be let loose on the cold meat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Paddock calls,&rdquo; said Clara from within; &ldquo;anon&mdash;anon!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, it is no jest, Clara,&rdquo; continued her
brother; &ldquo;for here is Lady Penelope miauling like a
starved cat!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I come&mdash;I come, greymalkin,&rdquo; answered Clara,
in the same vein as before, and entered the parlour
as she spoke, her finery entirely thrown aside, and
dressed in the riding-habit which was her usual and
favourite attire.</p>

<p>Her brother was both surprised and offended.
&ldquo;On my soul,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;Clara, this is behaving
very ill. I indulge you in every freak upon ordinary
occasions, but you might surely on this day,
of all others, have condescended to appear something
like my sister, and a gentlewoman receiving
company in her own house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, dearest John,&rdquo; said Clara, &ldquo;so that the
guests have enough to eat and drink, I cannot
conceive why I should concern myself about their
finery, or they trouble themselves about my plain
clothes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, come, Clara, this will not do,&rdquo; answered
Mowbray; &ldquo;you must positively go back into your
dressing-room, and huddle your things on as fast
as you can. You cannot go down to the company
dressed as you are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I certainly can, and I certainly will, John&mdash;I
have made a fool of myself once this morning to
oblige you, and for the rest of the day I am determined
to appear in my own dress; that is, in one
which shows I neither belong to the world, nor wish
to have any thing to do with its fashions.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_48" id="vol_ii_Page_48">[Pg&nbsp;48]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;By my soul, Clara, I will make you repent
this!&rdquo; said Mowbray, with more violence than he
usually exhibited where his sister was concerned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You cannot, dear John,&rdquo; she coolly replied,
&ldquo;unless by beating me; and that I think you would
repent of yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not know but what it were the best way
of managing you,&rdquo; said Mowbray, muttering between
his teeth; but, commanding his violence, he only
said aloud, &ldquo;I am sure, from long experience,
Clara, that your obstinacy will at the long run beat
my anger. Do let us compound the point for once&mdash;keep
your old habit, since you are so fond of
making a sight of yourself, and only throw the
shawl round your shoulders&mdash;it has been exceedingly
admired, and every woman in the house
longs to see it closer&mdash;they can hardly believe it
genuine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do be a man, Mowbray,&rdquo; answered his sister;
&ldquo;meddle with your horse-sheets, and leave shawls
alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you be a woman, Clara, and think a little
on them, when custom and decency render it
necessary.&mdash;Nay, is it possible!&mdash;Will you not
stir&mdash;not oblige me in such a trifle as this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would indeed if I could,&rdquo; said Clara; &ldquo;but
since you must know the truth&mdash;do not be angry&mdash;I
have not the shawl. I have given it away&mdash;given
it up, perhaps I should say, to the rightful
owner.&mdash;She has promised me something or other
in exchange for it, however. I have given it to
Lady Penelope.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Mowbray, &ldquo;some of the work
of her own fair hands, I suppose, or a couple of her
ladyship's drawings, made up into fire-screens.<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_49" id="vol_ii_Page_49">[Pg&nbsp;49]</a></span>&mdash;On
my word&mdash;on my soul, this is too bad!&mdash;It is
using me too ill, Clara&mdash;far too ill. If the thing
had been of no value, my giving it to you should
have fixed some upon it.&mdash;Good-even to you; we
will do as well as we can without you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, but, my dear John&mdash;stay but a moment,&rdquo;
said Clara, taking his arm as he sullenly turned
towards the door; &ldquo;there are but two of us on the
earth&mdash;do not let us quarrel about a trumpery
shawl.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Trumpery!&rdquo; said Mowbray; &ldquo;It cost fifty
guineas, by G&mdash;, which I can but ill spare&mdash;trumpery!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, never think of the cost,&rdquo; said Clara; &ldquo;it
was your gift, and that should, I own, have been
enough to have made me keep to my death's day
the poorest rag of it. But really Lady Penelope
looked so very miserable, and twisted her poor face
into so many odd expressions of anger and chagrin,
that I resigned it to her, and agreed to say she had
lent it to me for the performance. I believe she
was afraid that I would change my mind, or that
you would resume it as a seignorial waif; for, after
she had walked a few turns with it wrapped around
her, merely by way of taking possession, she dispatched
it by a special messenger to her apartment
at the Well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She may go to the devil,&rdquo; said Mowbray, &ldquo;for
a greedy unconscionable jade, who has varnished
over a selfish, spiteful heart, that is as hard as a
flint, with a fine glossing of taste and sensibility!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, but, John,&rdquo; replied his sister, &ldquo;she really
had something to complain of in the present case.
The shawl had been bespoken on her account, or
very nearly so&mdash;she showed me the tradesman's<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_50" id="vol_ii_Page_50">[Pg&nbsp;50]</a></span>
letter&mdash;only some agent of yours had come in
between with the ready money, which no tradesman
can resist.&mdash;Ah, John! I suspect half of your anger
is owing to the failure of a plan to mortify poor
Lady Pen, and that she has more to complain of
than you have.&mdash;Come, come, you have had the
advantage of her in the first display of this fatal
piece of finery, if wearing it on my poor shoulders
can be called a display&mdash;e'en make her welcome to
the rest for peace's sake, and let us go down to these
good folks, and you shall see how pretty and civil
I shall behave.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mowbray, a spoiled child, and with all the petted
habits of indulgence, was exceedingly fretted at the
issue of the scheme which he had formed for mortifying
Lady Penelope; but he saw at once the
necessity of saying nothing more to his sister on the
subject. Vengeance he privately muttered against
Lady Pen, whom he termed an absolute harpy in
blue-stockings; unjustly forgetting, that in the very
important affair at issue, he himself had been the
first to interfere with and defeat her ladyship's
designs on the garment in question.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I will blow her,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I will blow her
ladyship's conduct in the business! She shall not
outwit a poor whimsical girl like Clara, without
hearing it on more sides than one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With this Christian and gentlemanlike feeling
towards Lady Penelope, he escorted his sister into
the eating-room, and led her to her proper place at
the head of the table. It was the negligence displayed
in her dress, which occasioned the murmur
of surprise that greeted Clara on her entrance.
Mowbray, as he placed his sister in her chair, made
her general apology for her late appearance, and her<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_51" id="vol_ii_Page_51">[Pg&nbsp;51]</a></span>
riding-habit. &ldquo;Some fairies,&rdquo; he supposed, &ldquo;Puck,
or such like tricksy goblin, had been in her wardrobe,
and carried off whatever was fit for wearing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There were answers from every quarter&mdash;that it
would have been too much to expect Miss Mowbray
to dress for their amusement a second time&mdash;that
nothing she chose to wear could misbecome Miss
Mowbray&mdash;that she had set like the sun, in her
splendid scenic dress, and now rose like the full
moon in her ordinary attire, (this flight was by the
Reverend Mr. Chatterly,)&mdash;and that &ldquo;Miss Mowbray
being at hame, had an unco gude right to
please hersell;&rdquo; which last piece of politeness,
being at least as much to the purpose as any that
had preceded it, was the contribution of honest Mrs.
Blower; and was replied to by Miss Mowbray with
a particular and most gracious bow.</p>

<p>Mrs. Blower ought to have rested her colloquial
fame, as Dr. Johnson would have said, upon a compliment
so evidently acceptable, but no one knows
where to stop. She thrust her broad, good-natured,
delighted countenance forward, and sending her
voice from the bottom to the top of the table, like
her umquhile husband when calling to his mate
during a breeze, wondered &ldquo;why Miss Clara Moubrie
didna wear that grand shawl she had on at the
play-making, and her just sitting upon the wind
of a door. Nae doubt it was for fear of the soup,
and the butter-boats, and the like;&mdash;but <i>she</i> had
three shawls, which she really fand was ane ower
mony&mdash;if Miss Moubrie wad like to wear ane o'
them&mdash;it was but imitashion, to be sure&mdash;but it
wad keep her shouthers as warm as if it were real
Indian, and if it were dirtied it was the less
matter.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_52" id="vol_ii_Page_52">[Pg&nbsp;52]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Much obliged, Mrs. Blower,&rdquo; said Mowbray
unable to resist the temptation which this speech
offered; &ldquo;but my sister is not yet of quality sufficient,
to entitle her to rob her friends of their
shawls.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lady Penelope coloured to the eyes, and bitter
was the retort that arose to her tongue; but she
suppressed it, and nodding to Miss Mowbray in
the most friendly way in the world, yet with a very
particular expression, she only said, &ldquo;So you have
told your brother of the little transaction which we
have had this morning?&mdash;<i>Tu me lo pagherai</i>&mdash;I
give you fair warning, take care none of your secrets
come into my keeping&mdash;that's all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Upon what mere trifles do the important events of
human life sometimes depend! If Lady Penelope
had given way to her first movements of resentment,
the probable issue would have been some such
half-comic half-serious skirmish, as her ladyship
and Mr. Mowbray had often amused the company
withal. But revenge which is suppressed and
deferred, is always most to be dreaded; and to the
effects of the deliberate resentment which Lady
Penelope cherished upon this trifling occasion, must
be traced the events which our history has to
record. Secretly did she determine to return the
shawl, which she had entertained hopes of making
her own upon very reasonable terms; and as secretly
did she resolve to be revenged both upon brother
and sister, conceiving herself already possessed, to
a certain degree, of a clew to some part of their
family history, which might serve for a foundation
on which to raise her projected battery. The ancient
offences and emulation of importance of the Laird
of St. Ronan's, and the superiority which had been<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_53" id="vol_ii_Page_53">[Pg&nbsp;53]</a></span>
given to Clara in the exhibition of the day, combined
with the immediate cause of resentment; and
it only remained for her to consider how her revenge
should be most signally accomplished.</p>

<p>Whilst such thoughts were passing through Lady
Penelope's mind, Mowbray was searching with his
eyes for the Earl of Etherington, judging that it
might be proper, in the course of the entertainment,
or before the guests had separated, to make him
formally acquainted with his sister, as a preface to
the more intimate connexion which must, in prosecution
of the plan agreed upon, take place betwixt
them. Greatly to his surprise, the young Earl was
no where visible, and the place which he had occupied
by the side of Lady Binks had been quietly
appropriated by Winterblossom, as the best and
softest chair in the room, and nearest to the head of
the table, where the choicest of the entertainment is
usually arranged. This honest gentleman, after a
few insipid compliments to her ladyship upon her
performance as Queen of the Amazons, had betaken
himself to the much more interesting occupation of
ogling the dishes, through the glass which hung
suspended at his neck by a gold chain of Maltese
workmanship. After looking and wondering for a
few seconds, Mowbray addressed himself to the old
beau-gar&ccedil;on, and asked him what had become of
Etherington.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Retreated,&rdquo; said Winterblossom, &ldquo;and left but
his compliments to you behind him&mdash;a complaint,
I think, in his wounded arm.&mdash;Upon my word,
that soup has a most appetizing flavour!&mdash;Lady
Penelope, shall I have the honour to help you?&mdash;no!&mdash;nor
you, Lady Binks?&mdash;you are too cruel!&mdash;I
must comfort myself, like a heathen priest of<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_54" id="vol_ii_Page_54">[Pg&nbsp;54]</a></span>
old, by eating the sacrifice which the deities have
scorned to accept of.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here he helped himself to the plate of soup which
he had in vain offered to the ladies, and transferred
the further duty of dispensing it to Mr. Chatterly;
&ldquo;it is your profession, sir, to propitiate the divinities&mdash;ahem!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did not think Lord Etherington would have
left us so soon,&rdquo; said Mowbray; &ldquo;but we must do
the best we can without his countenance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So saying, he assumed his place at the bottom
of the table, and did his best to support the character
of a hospitable and joyous landlord, while on
her part, with much natural grace, and delicacy of
attention calculated to set every body at their ease,
his sister presided at the upper end of the board.
But the vanishing of Lord Etherington in a manner
so sudden and unaccountable&mdash;the obvious ill-humour
of Lady Penelope&mdash;and the steady, though
passive, sullenness of Lady Binks, spread among
the company a gloom like that produced by an
autumnal mist upon a pleasing landscape. The
women were low-spirited, dull, nay, peevish, they
did not well know why; and the men could not be
joyous, though the ready resource of old hock and
champagne made some of them talkative.&mdash;Lady
Penelope broke up the party by well-feigned apprehension
of the difficulties, nay, dangers, of returning
by so rough a road. Lady Binks begged a seat with
her ladyship, as Sir Bingo, she said, judging from
his devotion to the green flask, was likely to need
their carriage home. From the moment of their
departure, it became bad tone to remain behind;
and all, as in a retreating army, were eager to be
foremost, excepting MacTurk and a few stanch<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_55" id="vol_ii_Page_55">[Pg&nbsp;55]</a></span>
topers, who, unused to meet with such good cheer
every day of their lives, prudently determined to
make the most of the opportunity.</p>

<p>We will not dwell on the difficulties attending
the transportation of a large company by few
carriages, though the delay and disputes thereby
occasioned were of course more intolerable than in
the morning, for the parties had no longer the hopes
of a happy day before them, as a bribe to submit to
temporary inconvenience. The impatience of many
was so great, that, though the evening was raw,
they chose to go on foot rather than await the dull
routine of the returning carriages; and as they
retired they agreed, with one consent, to throw the
blame of whatever inconvenience they might sustain
on their host and hostess, who had invited so large
a party before getting a shorter and better road
made between the Well and Shaws-Castle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would have been so easy to repair the path
by the Buck-stane!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And this was all the thanks which Mr. Mowbray
received for an entertainment which had cost him
so much trouble and expense, and had been looked
forward to by the good society at the Well with
such impatient expectation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was an unco pleasant show,&rdquo; said the good-natured
Mrs. Blower, &ldquo;only it was a pity it was sae
tediousome; and there was surely an awfu' waste
of gauze and muslin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But so well had Dr. Quackleben improved his
numerous opportunities, that the good lady was
much reconciled to affairs in general, by the prospect
of coughs, rheumatisms, and other maladies
acquired upon the occasion, which were likely to
afford that learned gentleman, in whose prosperity<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_56" id="vol_ii_Page_56">[Pg&nbsp;56]</a></span>
she much interested herself, a very profitable
harvest.</p>

<p>Mowbray, somewhat addicted to the service of
Bacchus, did not find himself freed, by the secession
of so large a proportion of the company, from the
service of the jolly god, although, upon the present
occasion, he could well have dispensed with his
orgies. Neither the song, nor the pun, nor the jest,
had any power to kindle his heavy spirit, mortified
as he was by the event of his party being so different
from the brilliant consummation which he had
anticipated. The guests, stanch boon companions,
suffered not, however, their party to flag for want
of the landlord's participation, but continued to
drink bottle after bottle, with as little regard for
Mr. Mowbray's grave looks, as if they had been
carousing at the Mowbray Arms, instead of the
Mowbray mansion-house. Midnight at length released
him, when, with an unsteady step, he sought
his own apartment; cursing himself and his companions,
consigning his own person with all dispatch
to his bed, and bequeathing those of the company
to as many mosses and quagmires, as could be
found betwixt Shaws-Castle and St. Ronan's Well.<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_57" id="vol_ii_Page_57">[Pg&nbsp;57]</a></span></p>

<i>The Nun.</i><br />
</p>


<p>The morning after a debauch is usually one of
reflection, even to the most determined boon companion;
and, in the retrospect of the preceding day,
the young Laird of St. Ronan's saw nothing very
consolatory, unless that the excess was not, in the
present case, of his own seeking, but had arisen out
of the necessary duties of a landlord, or what were
considered as such by his companions.</p>

<p>But it was not so much his dizzy recollections of
the late carouse which haunted him on awakening,
as the inexplicability which seemed to shroud the
purposes and conduct of his new ally, the Earl of
Etherington.</p>

<p>That young nobleman had seen Miss Mowbray,
had declared his high satisfaction, had warmly and
voluntarily renewed the proposal which he had
made ere she was yet known to him&mdash;and yet, far
from seeking an opportunity to be introduced to
her, he had even left the party abruptly, in order
to avoid the necessary intercourse which must there
have taken place between them. His lordship's<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_58" id="vol_ii_Page_58">[Pg&nbsp;58]</a></span>
flirtation with Lady Binks had not escaped the
attention of the sagacious Mowbray&mdash;her ladyship
also had been in a hurry to leave Shaws-Castle; and
Mowbray promised to himself to discover the nature
of this connexion through Mrs. Gingham, her ladyship's
attendant, or otherwise; vowing deeply at
the same time, that no peer in the realm should
make an affectation of addressing Miss Mowbray a
cloak for another and more secret intrigue. But
his doubts on this subject were in great measure
removed by the arrival of one of Lord Etherington's
grooms with the following letter:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">My Dear Mowbray</span>,&mdash;You would naturally be
surprised at my escape from the table yesterday before
you returned to it, or your lovely sister had graced
it with her presence. I must confess my folly; and I
may do so the more boldly, for, as the footing on which
I first opened this treaty was not a very romantic one,
you will scarce suspect me of wishing to render it
such. But I did in reality feel, during the whole of
yesterday, a reluctance which I cannot express, to be
presented to the lady on whose favour the happiness of
my future life is to depend, upon such a public occasion,
and in the presence of so promiscuous a company.
I had my mask, indeed, to wear while in the promenade,
but, of course, that was to be laid aside at table,
and, consequently, I must have gone through the ceremony
of introduction; a most interesting moment,
which I was desirous to defer till a fitter season. I
trust you will permit me to call upon you at Shaws-Castle
this morning, in the hope&mdash;the anxious hope&mdash;of
being allowed to pay my duty to Miss Mowbray,
and apologize for not waiting upon her yesterday. I
expect your answer with the utmost impatience, being
always yours, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p style="text-align: right;">
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Etherington</span>.&rdquo;<br />
</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_59" id="vol_ii_Page_59">[Pg&nbsp;59]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; said St. Ronan's to himself, as he folded
the letter deliberately, after having twice read
it over, &ldquo;seems all fair and above board; I could
not wish any thing more explicit; and, moreover,
it puts into black and white, as old Mick would say,
what only rested before on our private conversation.
An especial cure for the headache, such a billet as
this in a morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So saying, he sat him down and wrote an answer,
expressing the pleasure he should have in seeing
his lordship as soon as he thought proper. He
watched even the departure of the groom, and
beheld him gallop off, with the speed of one who
knows that his quick return was expected by an
impatient master.</p>

<p>Mowbray remained for a few minutes by himself,
and reflected with delight upon the probable consequences
of this match;&mdash;the advancement of his
sister&mdash;and, above all, the various advantages which
must necessarily accrue to himself, by so close an
alliance with one whom he had good reason to think
deep <i>in the secret</i>, and capable of rendering him the
most material assistance in his speculations on the
turf and in the sporting world. He then sent a
servant to let Miss Mowbray know that he intended
to breakfast with her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose, John,&rdquo; said Clara, as her brother
entered the apartment, &ldquo;you are glad of a weaker
cup this morning than those you were drinking
last night&mdash;you were carousing till after the first
cock.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mowbray, &ldquo;that sandbed, old MacTurk,
upon whom whole hogsheads make no
impression, did make a bad boy of me&mdash;but the
day is over, and they will scarce catch me in such<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_60" id="vol_ii_Page_60">[Pg&nbsp;60]</a></span>
another scrape.&mdash;What did you think of the
masks?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Supported as well,&rdquo; said Clara, &ldquo;as such folk
support the disguise of gentlemen and ladies during
life; and that is, with a great deal of bustle, and
very little propriety.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I saw only one good mask there, and that was
a Spaniard,&rdquo; said her brother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, I saw him too,&rdquo; answered Clara; &ldquo;but he
wore his visor on. An old Indian merchant, or
some such thing, seemed to me a better character&mdash;the
Spaniard did nothing but stalk about and
twangle his guitar, for the amusement of my Lady
Binks, as I think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is a very clever fellow, though, that same
Spaniard,&rdquo; rejoined Mowbray&mdash;&ldquo;Can you guess
who he is?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, indeed; nor shall I take the trouble of
trying. To set to guessing about it, were as bad as
seeing the whole mummery over again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; replied her brother, &ldquo;you will allow one
thing at least&mdash;Bottom was well acted&mdash;you cannot
deny that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Clara, &ldquo;that worthy really deserved
to wear his ass's head to the end of the chapter&mdash;but
what of him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only conceive that he should be the very same
person with that handsome Spaniard,&rdquo; replied
Mowbray.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then there is one fool fewer than I thought there
was,&rdquo; replied Clara, with the greatest indifference.</p>

<p>Her brother bit his lip.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Clara,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I believe you are an excellent
good girl, and clever to boot, but pray do not
set up for wit and oddity; there is nothing in life<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_61" id="vol_ii_Page_61">[Pg&nbsp;61]</a></span>
so intolerable as pretending to think differently
from other people.&mdash;That gentleman was the Earl
of Etherington.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This annunciation, though made in what was
meant to be an imposing tone, had no impression on
Clara.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope he plays the peer better than the Fidalgo,&rdquo;
she replied, carelessly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Mowbray, &ldquo;he is one of the
handsomest men of the time, and decidedly fashionable&mdash;you
will like him much when you see him
in private.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is of little consequence whether I do or no,&rdquo;
answered Clara.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mistake the matter,&rdquo; said Mowbray, gravely;
&ldquo;it may be of considerable consequence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; said Clara, with a smile; &ldquo;I must
suppose myself, then, too important a person not
to make my approbation necessary to one of your
first-rates? He cannot pretend to pass muster at
St. Ronan's without it?&mdash;Well, I will depute my
authority to Lady Binks, and she shall pass your
new recruits instead of me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is all nonsense, Clara,&rdquo; said Mowbray.
&ldquo;Lord Etherington calls here this very morning,
and wishes to be made known to you. I expect you
will receive him as a particular friend of mine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;With all my heart&mdash;so you will engage, after
this visit, to keep him down with your other
particular friends at the Well&mdash;you know it is a
bargain that you bring neither buck nor pointer
into my parlour&mdash;the one worries my cat, and the
other my temper.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mistake me entirely, Clara&mdash;this is a very
different visitor from any I have ever introduced<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_62" id="vol_ii_Page_62">[Pg&nbsp;62]</a></span>
to you&mdash;I expect to see him often here, and I hope
you and he will be better friends than you think of.
I have more reasons for wishing this, than I have
now time to tell you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Clara remained silent for an instant, then looked
at her brother with an anxious and scrutinizing
glance, as if she wished to penetrate into his inmost
purpose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I thought,&rdquo;&mdash;she said, after a minute's consideration,
and with an altered and disturbed tone;
&ldquo;but no&mdash;I will not think that Heaven intends me
such a blow&mdash;least of all, that it should come from
your hands.&rdquo; She walked hastily to the window,
and threw it open&mdash;then shut it again, and returned
to her seat, saying, with a constrained smile, &ldquo;May
Heaven forgive you, brother, but you frightened me
heartily.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did not mean to do so, Clara,&rdquo; said Mowbray,
who saw the necessity of soothing her; &ldquo;I only
alluded in joke to those chances that are never out
of other girls' heads, though you never seem to calculate
on them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish you, my dear John,&rdquo; said Clara, struggling
to regain entire composure, &ldquo;I wish <i>you</i> would
profit by my example, and give up the science of
chance also&mdash;it will not avail you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How d'ye know that?&mdash;I'll show you the
contrary, you silly wench,&rdquo; answered Mowbray&mdash;&ldquo;Here
is a banker's bill, payable to your own order,
for the cash you lent me, and something over&mdash;don't
let old Mick have the fingering, but let Bindloose
manage it for you&mdash;he is the honester man
between two d&mdash;&mdash;d knaves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will not you, brother, send it to the man
Bindloose yourself?&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_63" id="vol_ii_Page_63">[Pg&nbsp;63]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&mdash;no,&rdquo; replied Mowbray&mdash;&ldquo;he might confuse
it with some of my transactions, and so you
forfeit your stake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I am glad you are able to pay me, for I
want to buy Campbell's new work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish you joy of your purchase&mdash;but don't
scratch me for not caring about it&mdash;I know as little
of books as you of the long odds. And come now,
be serious, and tell me if you will be a good girl&mdash;lay
aside your whims, and receive this English young
nobleman like a lady as you are?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That were easy,&rdquo; said Clara&mdash;&ldquo;but&mdash;but&mdash;Pray,
ask no more of me than just to see him.&mdash;Say
to him at once, I am a poor creature in body,
in mind, in spirits, in temper, in understanding&mdash;above
all, say that I can receive him only once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall say no such thing,&rdquo; said Mowbray,
bluntly; &ldquo;it is good to be plain with you at once&mdash;I
thought of putting off this discussion&mdash;but
since it must come, the sooner it is over the better.&mdash;You
are to understand, Clara Mowbray, that
Lord Etherington has a particular view in this
visit, and that his view has my full sanction
and approbation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought so,&rdquo; said Clara, in the same altered
tone of voice in which she had before spoken; &ldquo;my
mind foreboded this last of misfortunes!&mdash;But,
Mowbray, you have no child before you&mdash;I neither
will nor can see this nobleman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How!&rdquo; exclaimed Mowbray, fiercely; &ldquo;do you
dare return me so peremptory an answer?&mdash;Think
better of it, for, if we differ, you will find you will
have the worst of the game.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rely upon it,&rdquo; she continued, with more vehemence,
&ldquo;I will see him nor no man upon the footing<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_64" id="vol_ii_Page_64">[Pg&nbsp;64]</a></span>
you mention&mdash;my resolution is taken, and threats
and entreaties will prove equally unavailing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Upon my word, madam,&rdquo; said Mowbray, &ldquo;you
have, for a modest and retired young lady, plucked
up a goodly spirit of your own!&mdash;But you shall
find mine equals it. If you do not agree to see my
friend Lord Etherington, ay, and to receive him
with the politeness due to the consideration I entertain
for him, by Heaven! Clara, I will no longer
regard you as my father's daughter. Think what
you are giving up&mdash;the affection and protection of
a brother&mdash;and for what?&mdash;merely for an idle
point of etiquette.&mdash;You cannot, I suppose, even
in the workings of your romantic brain, imagine
that the days of Clarissa Harlowe and Harriet
Byron are come back again, when women were
married by main force? and it is monstrous vanity
in you to suppose that Lord Etherington, since he
has honoured you with any thoughts at all, will
not be satisfied with a proper and civil refusal&mdash;You
are no such prize, methinks, that the days of
romance are to come back for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I care not what days they are,&rdquo; said Clara&mdash;&ldquo;I
tell you I will not see Lord Etherington, or
any one else, upon such preliminaries as you have
stated&mdash;I cannot&mdash;I will not&mdash;and I ought not.&mdash;Had
you meant me to receive him, which can be
a matter of no consequence whatever, you should
have left him on the footing of an ordinary visitor&mdash;as
it is, I will not see him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You <i>shall</i> see and hear him both,&rdquo; said Mowbray;
&ldquo;you shall find me as obstinate as you are&mdash;as
willing to forget I am a brother, as you to forget
that you have one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is time, then,&rdquo; replied Clara, &ldquo;that this<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_65" id="vol_ii_Page_65">[Pg&nbsp;65]</a></span>
house, once our father's, should no longer hold us
both. I can provide for myself, and may God bless
you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You take it coolly, madam,&rdquo; said her brother,
walking through the apartment with much anxiety
both of look and gesture.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;for it is what I have
often foreseen&mdash;Yes, brother, I have often foreseen
that you would make your sister the subject
of your plots and schemes, so soon as other stakes
failed you. That hour is come, and I am, as you
see, prepared to meet it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And where may you propose to retire to?&rdquo; said
Mowbray. &ldquo;I think that I, your only relation and
natural guardian, have a right to know that&mdash;my
honour and that of my family is concerned.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your honour!&rdquo; she retorted, with a keen glance
at him; &ldquo;your interest, I suppose you mean, is
somehow connected with the place of my abode.&mdash;But
keep yourself patient&mdash;the den of the rock,
the linn of the brook, should be my choice, rather
than a palace without my freedom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are mistaken, however,&rdquo; said Mowbray,
sternly, &ldquo;if you hope to enjoy more freedom than
I think you capable of making a good use of. The
law authorizes, and reason, and even affection,
require, that you should be put under restraint for
your own safety, and that of your character. You
roamed the woods a little too much in my father's
time, if all stories be true.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did&mdash;I did indeed, Mowbray,&rdquo; said Clara,
weeping; &ldquo;God pity me, and forgive you for
upbraiding me with my state of mind&mdash;I know I
cannot sometimes trust my own judgment; but is
it for you to remind me of this?&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_66" id="vol_ii_Page_66">[Pg&nbsp;66]</a></span></p>

<p>Mowbray was at once softened and embarrassed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What folly is this?&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;you say the
most cutting things to me&mdash;are ready to fly from
my house&mdash;and when I am provoked to make an
angry answer, you burst into tears!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say you did not mean what you said, my dearest
brother!&rdquo; exclaimed Clara; &ldquo;O say you did
not mean it!&mdash;Do not take my liberty from me&mdash;it
is all I have left, and, God knows, it is a poor
comfort in the sorrows I undergo. I will put a fair
face on every thing&mdash;will go down to the Well&mdash;will
wear what you please, and say what you please&mdash;but
O! leave me the liberty of my solitude here&mdash;let
me weep alone in the house of my father&mdash;and
do not force a broken-hearted sister to lay her
death at your door.&mdash;My span must be a brief one,
but let not your hand shake the sand-glass!&mdash;Disturb
me not&mdash;let me pass quietly&mdash;I do not ask
this so much for my sake as for your own. I would
have you think of me, sometimes, Mowbray, after
I am gone, and without the bitter reflections which
the recollection of harsh usage will assuredly bring
with it. Pity me, were it but for your own sake.&mdash;I
have deserved nothing but compassion at your
hand&mdash;There are but two of us on earth, why
should we make each other miserable?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She accompanied these entreaties with a flood of
tears, and the most heart-bursting sobs. Mowbray
knew not what to determine. On the one hand, he
was bound by his promise to the Earl; on the other,
his sister was in no condition to receive such a visitor;
nay, it was most probable, that if he adopted
the strong measure of compelling her to receive
him, her behaviour would probably be such as
totally to break off the projected match, on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_67" id="vol_ii_Page_67">[Pg&nbsp;67]</a></span>
success of which he had founded so many castles in
the air. In this dilemma, he had again recourse to
argument.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Clara,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I am, as I have repeatedly
said, your only relation and guardian&mdash;if there be
any real reason why you ought not to receive, and,
at least, make a civil reply to such a negotiation as
the Earl of Etherington has thought fit to open,
surely I ought to be intrusted with it. You enjoyed
far too much of that liberty which you seem to prize
so highly during my father's lifetime&mdash;in the last
years of it at least&mdash;have you formed any foolish
attachment during that time, which now prevents
you from receiving such a visit as Lord Etherington
has threatened?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Threatened!&mdash;the expression is well chosen,&rdquo;
said Miss Mowbray; &ldquo;and nothing can be
more dreadful than such a threat, excepting its
accomplishment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am glad your spirits are reviving,&rdquo; replied her
brother; &ldquo;but that is no answer to my question.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it necessary,&rdquo; said Clara, &ldquo;that one must
have actually some engagement or entanglement, to
make them unwilling to be given in marriage, or
even to be pestered upon such a subject?&mdash;Many
young men declare they intend to die bachelors,
why may not I be permitted to commence old maid
at three-and-twenty?&mdash;Let me do so, like a kind
brother, and there were never nephews and nieces
so petted and so scolded, so nursed and so cuffed by
a maiden aunt, as your children, when you have
them, shall be by aunt Clara.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And why not say all this to Lord Etherington?&rdquo;
said Mowbray; &ldquo;wait until he propose such a terrible
bugbear as matrimony, before you refuse to<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_68" id="vol_ii_Page_68">[Pg&nbsp;68]</a></span>
receive him. Who knows, the whim that he hinted
at may have passed away&mdash;he was, as you say,
flirting with Lady Binks, and her ladyship has a
good deal of address, as well as beauty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Heaven improve both, (in an honest way,) if she
will but keep his lordship to herself!&rdquo; said Clara.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; continued her brother, &ldquo;things
standing thus, I do not think you will have much
trouble with his lordship&mdash;no more, perhaps, than
just to give him a civil denial. After having spoken
on such a subject to a man of my condition, he
cannot well break off without you give him an
apology.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If that is all,&rdquo; said Clara, &ldquo;he shall, as soon as
he gives me an opportunity, receive such an answer
as will leave him at liberty to woo any one whatsoever
of Eve's daughters, excepting Clara Mowbray.
Methinks I am so eager to set the captive free,
that I now wish as much for his lordship's appearance
as I feared it a little while since.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, nay, but let us go fair and softly,&rdquo; said
her brother. &ldquo;You are not to refuse him before he
asks the question.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said Clara; &ldquo;but I well know how
to manage that&mdash;he shall never ask the question at
all. I will restore Lady Binks's admirer, without
accepting so much as a civility in ransom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Worse and worse, Clara,&rdquo; answered Mowbray;
&ldquo;you are to remember he is my friend and guest,
and he must not be affronted in my house. Leave
things to themselves.&mdash;Besides, consider an instant,
Clara&mdash;had you not better take a little time for
reflection in this case? The offer is a splendid one&mdash;title&mdash;fortune&mdash;and,
what is more, a fortune
which you will be well entitled to share largely in.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_69" id="vol_ii_Page_69">[Pg&nbsp;69]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;This is beyond our implied treaty,&rdquo; said Clara.
&ldquo;I have yielded more than ever I thought I should
have done, when I agreed that this Earl should be
introduced to me on the footing of a common visitor;
and now you talk favourably of his pretensions.
This is an encroachment, Mowbray, and now I shall
relapse into my obstinacy, and refuse to see him
at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do as you will,&rdquo; replied Mowbray, sensible that
it was only by working on her affections that he had
any chance of carrying a point against her inclination,&mdash;&ldquo;Do
as you will, my dear Clara; but, for
Heaven's sake, wipe your eyes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And behave myself,&rdquo; said she, trying to smile
as she obeyed him,&mdash;&ldquo;behave myself, you would
say, like folks of this world; but the quotation
is lost on you, who never read either Prior or
Shakspeare.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thank Heaven for that,&rdquo; said Mowbray. &ldquo;I
have enough to burden my brain, without carrying
such a lumber of rhymes in it as you and Lady Pen
do.&mdash;Come, that is right; go to the mirror, and
make yourself decent.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A woman must be much borne down indeed by
pain and suffering, when she loses all respect for
her external appearance. The madwoman in Bedlam
wears her garland of straw with a certain air
of pretension; and we have seen a widow whom we
knew to be most sincerely affected by a recent deprivation,
whose weeds, nevertheless, were arranged
with a dolorous degree of grace, which amounted
almost to coquetry. Clara Mowbray had also, negligent
as she seemed to be of appearances, her own
art of the toilet, although of the most rapid and
most simple character. She took off her little<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_70" id="vol_ii_Page_70">[Pg&nbsp;70]</a></span>
riding-hat, and, unbinding a lace of Indian gold
which retained her locks, shook them in dark and
glossy profusion over her very handsome form, which
they overshadowed down to her slender waist; and
while her brother stood looking on her with a mixture
of pride, affection, and compassion, she arranged
them with a large comb, and, without the assistance of
any <i>femme d'atours</i>, wove them, in the course of a
few minutes, into such a natural head-dress as we
see on the statues of the Grecian nymphs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now let me but find my best muff,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;come prince and peer, I shall be ready to receive
them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pshaw! your muff&mdash;who has heard of such a
thing these twenty years? Muffs were out of fashion
before you were born.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No matter, John,&rdquo; replied his sister; &ldquo;when a
woman wears a muff, especially a determined old
maid like myself, it is a sign she has no intentions
to scratch; and therefore the muff serves all the
purposes of a white flag, and prevents the necessity of
drawing on a glove, so prudentially recommended
by the motto of our cousins, the M'Intoshes.&rdquo;<a name="vol_ii_FNanchor_4_4" id="vol_ii_FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#vol_ii_Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>&ldquo;Be it as you will, then,&rdquo; said Mowbray; &ldquo;for
other than you do will it, you will not suffer it to
be.&mdash;But how is this!&mdash;another billet?&mdash;We are
in request this morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Heaven send his lordship may have judiciously
considered all the risks which he is sure to
encounter on this charmed ground, and resolved
to leave his adventure unattempted,&rdquo; said Miss
Mowbray.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_71" id="vol_ii_Page_71">[Pg&nbsp;71]</a></span></p>
<p>Her brother glanced a look of displeasure at her,
as he broke the seal of the letter, which was
addressed to him with the words, &ldquo;Haste and
secrecy,&rdquo; written on the envelope. The contents,
which greatly surprised him, we remit to the
commencement of the next chapter.<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_72" id="vol_ii_Page_72">[Pg&nbsp;72]</a></span></p>

</p>


<p>The billet which Mowbray received, and read in his
sister's presence, contained these words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;Clara Mowbray has few friends&mdash;none, perhaps,
excepting yourself, in right of blood, and the
writer of this letter, by right of the fondest, truest,
and most disinterested attachment, that ever man bore
to woman. I am thus explicit with you, because,
though it is unlikely that I should ever again see or
speak to your sister, I am desirous that you should be
clearly acquainted with the cause of that interest, which
I must always, even to my dying breath, take in her
affairs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The person, calling himself Lord Etherington, is,
I am aware, in the neighbourhood of Shaws-Castle, with
the intention of paying his addresses to Miss Mowbray;
and it is easy for me to foresee, arguing according to
the ordinary views of mankind, that he may place his
proposals in such a light as may make them seem
highly desirable. But ere you give this person the
encouragement which his offers may seem to deserve,
please to enquire whether his fortune is certain, or his
rank indisputable; and be not satisfied with light<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_73" id="vol_ii_Page_73">[Pg&nbsp;73]</a></span>
evidence on either point. A man may be in possession
of an estate and title, to which he has no better right
than his own rapacity and forwardness of assumption;
and supposing Mr. Mowbray jealous, as he must be, of
the honour of his family, the alliance of such a one
cannot but bring disgrace. This comes from one who
will make good what he has written.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>On the first perusal of a billet so extraordinary,
Mowbray was inclined to set it down to the malice
of some of the people at the Well, anonymous letters
being no uncommon resource of the small wits
who frequent such places of general resort, as a
species of deception safely and easily executed, and
well calculated to produce much mischief and confusion.
But upon closer consideration, he was
shaken in this opinion, and, starting suddenly from
the reverie into which he had fallen, asked for the
messenger who had brought the letter. &ldquo;He was in
the hall,&rdquo; the servant thought, and Mowbray ran to
the hall. No&mdash;the messenger was not there, but
Mowbray might see his back as he walked up the
avenue.&mdash;He hollo'd&mdash;no answer was returned&mdash;he
ran after the fellow, whose appearance was that
of a countryman. The man quickened his pace as
he saw himself pursued, and when he got out of the
avenue, threw himself into one of the numerous
bypaths which wanderers, who strayed in quest of
nuts, or for the sake of exercise, had made in various
directions through the extensive copse which
surrounded the Castle, and were doubtless the
reason of its acquiring the name of Shaws, which
signifies, in the Scottish dialect, a wood of this
description.</p>

<p>Irritated by the man's obvious desire to avoid
him, and naturally obstinate in all his resolutions,<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_74" id="vol_ii_Page_74">[Pg&nbsp;74]</a></span>
Mowbray pursued for a considerable way, until he
fairly lost breath; and the flier having been long
out of sight, he recollected at length that his
engagement with the Earl of Etherington required
his attendance at the Castle.</p>

<p>The young lord, indeed, had arrived at Shaws-Castle,
so few minutes after Mowbray's departure,
that it was wonderful they had not met in the avenue.
The servant to whom he applied, conceiving
that his master must return instantly, as he had
gone out without his hat, ushered the Earl, without
farther ceremony, into the breakfast-room, where
Clara was seated upon one of the window-seats, so
busily employed with a book, or perhaps with her
own thoughts while she held a book in her hands,
that she scarce raised her head, until Lord Etherington,
advancing, pronounced the words, &ldquo;Miss
Mowbray.&rdquo; A start, and a loud scream, announced
her deadly alarm, and these were repeated as he
made one pace nearer, and in a firmer accent said,
&ldquo;Clara.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No nearer&mdash;no nearer,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;if you
would have me look upon you and live!&rdquo; Lord
Etherington remained standing, as if uncertain
whether to advance or retreat, while with incredible
rapidity she poured out her hurried entreaties
that he would begone, sometimes addressing him
as a real personage, sometimes, and more frequently,
as a delusive phantom, the offspring of her
own excited imagination. &ldquo;I knew it,&rdquo; she muttered,
&ldquo;I knew what would happen, if my thoughts
were forced into that fearful channel.&mdash;Speak to
me, brother! speak to me while I have reason left,
and tell me that what stands before me is but
an empty shadow! But it is no shadow&mdash;it<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_75" id="vol_ii_Page_75">[Pg&nbsp;75]</a></span>
remains before me in all the lineaments of mortal
substance!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Clara,&rdquo; said the Earl, with a firm, yet softened
voice, &ldquo;collect and compose yourself. I am, indeed,
no shadow&mdash;I am a much-injured man, come to
demand rights which have been unjustly withheld
from me. I am now armed with power as well as
justice, and my claims shall be heard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never&mdash;never!&rdquo; replied Clara Mowbray; &ldquo;since
extremity is my portion, let extremity give me
courage.&mdash;You have no rights&mdash;none&mdash;I know
you not, and I defy you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Defy me not, Clara Mowbray,&rdquo; answered the
Earl, in a tone, and with a manner how different
from those which delighted society! for now he was
solemn, tragic, and almost stern, like the judge
when he passes sentence upon a criminal. &ldquo;Defy
me not,&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;I am your Fate, and it
rests with you to make me a kind or severe one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dare you speak thus?&rdquo; said Clara, her eyes
flashing with anger, while her lips grew white, and
quivered for fear&mdash;&ldquo;Dare you speak thus, and
remember that the same heaven is above our
heads, to which you so solemnly vowed you would
never see me more without my own consent?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That vow was conditional&mdash;Francis Tyrrel, as
he calls himself, swore the same&mdash;hath <i>he</i> not
seen you?&rdquo; He fixed a piercing look on her; &ldquo;He
has&mdash;you dare not disown it!&mdash;And shall an oath,
which to him is but a cobweb, be to me a shackle
of iron?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alas! it was but for a moment,&rdquo; said Miss
Mowbray, sinking in courage, and drooping her head
as she spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Were it but the twentieth part of an instant<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_76" id="vol_ii_Page_76">[Pg&nbsp;76]</a></span>&mdash;the
least conceivable space of subdivided time&mdash;still,
you <i>did</i> meet&mdash;he saw you&mdash;you spoke to
him. And me also you must see&mdash;me also you
must hear! Or I will first claim you for my own
in the face of the world; and, having vindicated my
rights, I will seek out and extinguish the wretched
rival who has dared to interfere with them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you speak thus?&rdquo; said Clara&mdash;&ldquo;can you so
burst through the ties of nature?&mdash;Have you a heart!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have; and it shall be moulded like wax to your
slightest wishes, if you agree to do me justice; but
not granite, nor aught else that nature has of hardest,
will be more inflexible if you continue an useless
opposition!&mdash;Clara Mowbray, I am your Fate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not so, proud man,&rdquo; said Clara, rising, &ldquo;God
gave not one potsherd the power to break another,
save by his divine permission&mdash;my fate is in the
will of Him, without whose will even a sparrow
falls not to the ground.&mdash;Begone&mdash;I am strong in
faith of heavenly protection.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you speak thus in sincerity?&rdquo; said the Earl
of Etherington; &ldquo;consider first what is the prospect
before you. I stand here in no doubtful or
ambiguous character&mdash;I offer not the mere name
of a husband&mdash;propose to you not a humble lot of
obscurity and hardship, with fears for the past
and doubts for the future; yet there <i>was</i> a time
when to a suit like this you could listen favourably.&mdash;I
stand high among the nobles of the country,
and offer you, as my bride, your share in my
honours, and in the wealth which becomes them.&mdash;Your
brother is my friend, and favours my suit. I
will raise from the ground, and once more render
illustrious, your ancient house&mdash;your motions shall
be regulated by your wishes, even by your caprices<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_77" id="vol_ii_Page_77">[Pg&nbsp;77]</a></span>&mdash;I
will even carry my self-denial so far, that you
shall, should you insist on so severe a measure,
have your own residence, your own establishment,
and without intrusion on my part, until the most
devoted love, the most unceasing attentions, shall
make way on your inflexible disposition.&mdash;All this
I will consent to for the future&mdash;all that is past
shall be concealed from the public.&mdash;But mine,
Clara Mowbray, you must be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never&mdash;never!&rdquo; she said with increasing
vehemence. &ldquo;I can but repeat a negative, but it
shall have all the force of an oath.&mdash;Your rank is
nothing to me&mdash;your fortune I scorn&mdash;my brother
has no right, by the law of Scotland, or of nature,
to compel my inclinations.&mdash;I detest your treachery,
and I scorn the advantage you propose to attain by
it.&mdash;Should the law give you my hand, it would
but award you that of a corpse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alas! Clara,&rdquo; said the Earl, &ldquo;you do but flutter
in the net; but I will urge you no farther, now&mdash;there
is another encounter before me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was turning away, when Clara, springing
forward, caught him by the arm, and repeated, in
a low and impressive voice, the commandment,&mdash;&ldquo;Thou
shalt do no murder!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fear not any violence,&rdquo; he said, softening his
voice, and attempting to take her hand, &ldquo;but what
may flow from your own severity.&mdash;Francis is safe
from me, unless you are altogether unreasonable.&mdash;Allow
me but what you cannot deny to any friend
of your brother, the power of seeing you at times&mdash;suspend
at least the impetuosity of your dislike
to me, and I will, on my part, modify the current of
my just and otherwise uncontrollable resentment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Clara, extricating herself, and retreating from<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_78" id="vol_ii_Page_78">[Pg&nbsp;78]</a></span>
him, only replied, &ldquo;There is a Heaven above us,
and <span class="smcap lowercase">THERE</span> shall be judged our actions towards
each other! You abuse a power most treacherously
obtained&mdash;you break a heart that never did
you wrong&mdash;you seek an alliance with a wretch
who only wishes to be wedded to her grave.&mdash;If
my brother brings you hither, I cannot help it&mdash;and
if your coming prevents bloody and unnatural
violence, it is so far well.&mdash;But by my consent
you come <i>not</i>; and, were the choice mine, I would
rather be struck with life-long blindness, than that
my eyes should again open on your person&mdash;rather
that my ears were stuffed with the earth of the grave,
than that they should again hear your voice!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Earl of Etherington smiled proudly, and
replied, &ldquo;Even this, madam, I can hear without
resentment. Anxious and careful as you are to
deprive your compliance of every grace and of every
kindness, I receive the permission to wait on you,
as I interpret your words.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do not so interpret them,&rdquo; she replied; &ldquo;I do
but submit to your presence as an unavoidable evil.
Heaven be my witness, that, were it not to prevent
greater and more desperate evil, I would not even
so far acquiesce.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let acquiescence, then, be the word,&rdquo; he said;
&ldquo;and so thankful will I be, even for your acquiescence,
Miss Mowbray, that all shall remain private,
which I conceive you do not wish to be disclosed;
and, unless absolutely compelled to it in self-defence,
you may rely, no violence will be resorted
to by me in any quarter.&mdash;I relieve you from my
presence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So saying, he withdrew from the apartment.<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_79" id="vol_ii_Page_79">[Pg&nbsp;79]</a></span></p>

<span style="margin-left: 4em;">&mdash;&mdash;By your leave, gentle wax.<br /></span>
</p>
<p class="citation">
<span class="smcap">Shakspeare</span>.<br />
</p>


<p>In the hall of Shaws-Castle the Earl of Etherington
met Mowbray, returned from his fruitless chase
after the bearer of the anonymous epistle before
recited; and who had but just learned, on his return,
that the Earl of Etherington was with his sister.
There was a degree of mutual confusion when they
met; for Mowbray had the contents of the anonymous
letter fresh in his mind, and Lord Etherington,
notwithstanding all the coolness which he had
endeavoured to maintain, had not gone through the
scene with Clara without discomposure. Mowbray
asked the Earl whether he had seen his sister, and
invited him, at the same time, to return to the
parlour; and his lordship replied, in a tone as indifferent
as he could assume, that he had enjoyed the
honour of the lady's company for several minutes,
and would not now intrude farther upon Miss
Mowbray's patience.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have had such a reception as was agreeable,
my lord, I trust?&rdquo; said Mowbray. &ldquo;I hope
Clara did the honours of the house with propriety
during my absence?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Mowbray seemed a little fluttered with
my sudden appearance,&rdquo; said the Earl; &ldquo;the servant<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_80" id="vol_ii_Page_80">[Pg&nbsp;80]</a></span>
showed me in rather abruptly; and, circumstanced
as we were, there is always awkwardness in a first
meeting, where there is no third party to act as
master of the ceremonies.&mdash;I suspect, from the
lady's looks, that you have not quite kept my
secret, my good friend. I myself, too, felt a little
consciousness in approaching Miss Mowbray&mdash;but
it is over now; and, the ice being fairly
broken, I hope to have other and more convenient
opportunities to improve the advantage I have just
gained in acquiring your lovely sister's personal
acquaintance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So be it,&rdquo; said Mowbray; &ldquo;but, as you declare
for leaving the castle just now, I must first speak
a single word with your lordship, for which this
place is not altogether convenient.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can have no objections, my dear Jack,&rdquo; said
Etherington, following him with a thrill of conscious
feeling, somewhat perhaps like that of the
spider when he perceives his deceitful web is threatened
with injury, and sits balanced in the centre,
watching every point, and uncertain which he may
be called upon first to defend. Such is one part,
and not the slightest part, of the penance which
never fails to wait on those, who, abandoning the
&ldquo;fair play of the world,&rdquo; endeavour to work out
their purposes by a process of deception and
intrigue.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; said Mowbray, when they had
entered a little apartment, in which the latter kept
his guns, fishing-tackle, and other implements of
sport, &ldquo;you have played on the square with me;
nay, more&mdash;I am bound to allow you have given
me great odds. I am therefore not entitled to hear
any reports to the prejudice of your lordship's<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_81" id="vol_ii_Page_81">[Pg&nbsp;81]</a></span>
character, without instantly communicating them.
There is an anonymous letter which I have just
received. Perhaps your lordship may know the
hand, and thus be enabled to detect the writer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do know the hand,&rdquo; said the Earl, as he
received the note from Mowbray; &ldquo;and, allow me
to say, it is the only one which could have dared to
frame any calumny to my prejudice. I hope, Mr.
Mowbray, it is impossible for you to consider this
infamous charge as any thing but a falsehood?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My placing it in your lordship's hands, without
farther enquiry, is a sufficient proof that I hold it
such, my lord; at the same time that I cannot
doubt for a moment that your lordship has it in
your power to overthrow so frail a calumny by the
most satisfactory evidence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Unquestionably I can, Mr. Mowbray,&rdquo; said the
Earl; &ldquo;for, besides my being in full possession of
the estate and title of my father, the late Earl
of Etherington, I have my father's contract of
marriage, my own certificate of baptism, and the
evidence of the whole country, to establish my
right. All these shall be produced with the least
delay possible. You will not think it surprising
that one does not travel with this sort of documents
in one's post-chaise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly not, my lord,&rdquo; said Mowbray; &ldquo;it
is sufficient they are forthcoming when called for.
But, may I enquire, my lord, who the writer of this
letter is, and whether he has any particular spleen
to gratify by this very impudent assertion, which
is so easily capable of being disproved?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is,&rdquo; said Etherington, &ldquo;or, at least, has
the reputation of being, I am sorry to say, a near&mdash;a
very near relation of my own&mdash;in fact, a<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_82" id="vol_ii_Page_82">[Pg&nbsp;82]</a></span>
brother by the father's side, but illegitimate.&mdash;My
father was fond of him&mdash;I loved him also, for he
has uncommonly fine parts, and is accounted highly
accomplished. But there is a strain of something
irregular in his mind&mdash;a vein, in short, of madness,
which breaks out in the usual manner, rendering
the poor young man a dupe to vain imaginations of
his own dignity and grandeur, which is perhaps the
most ordinary effect of insanity, and inspiring the
deepest aversion against his nearest relatives, and
against myself in particular. He is a man extremely
plausible, both in speech and manners; so much
so, that many of my friends think there is more
vice than insanity in the irregularities which he
commits; but I may, I hope, be forgiven, if I have
formed a milder judgment of one supposed to be
my father's son. Indeed, I cannot help being sorry
for poor Frank, who might have made a very distinguished
figure in the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;May I ask the gentleman's name, my lord?&rdquo;
said Mowbray.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My father's indulgence gave him our family
name of Tyrrel, with his own Christian name Francis;
but his proper name, to which alone he has a
right, is Martigny.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Francis Tyrrel!&rdquo; exclaimed Mowbray; &ldquo;why,
that is the name of the very person who made some
disturbance at the Well just before your lordship
arrived.&mdash;You may have seen an advertisement&mdash;a
sort of placard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have, Mr. Mowbray,&rdquo; said the Earl. &ldquo;Spare
me on that subject, if you please&mdash;it has formed a
strong reason why I did not mention my connexion
with this unhappy man before; but it is no unusual
thing for persons, whose imaginations are excited,<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_83" id="vol_ii_Page_83">[Pg&nbsp;83]</a></span>
to rush into causeless quarrels, and then to make
discreditable retreats from them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Or,&rdquo; said Mr. Mowbray, &ldquo;he may have, after all,
been prevented from reaching the place of rendezvous&mdash;it
was that very day on which your lordship,
I think, received your wound; and, if I mistake not,
you hit the man from whom you got the hurt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mowbray,&rdquo; said Lord Etherington, lowering
his voice, and taking him by the arm, &ldquo;it is true
that I did so&mdash;and truly glad I am to observe,
that, whatever might have been the consequences
of such an accident, they cannot have been serious.&mdash;It
struck me afterwards, that the man by whom
I was so strangely assaulted, had some resemblance
to the unfortunate Tyrrel&mdash;but I had not seen him
for years.&mdash;At any rate, he cannot have been much
hurt, since he is now able to resume his intrigues
to the prejudice of my character.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your lordship views the thing with a firm eye,&rdquo;
said Mowbray; &ldquo;firmer than I think most people
would be able to command, who had so narrow a
chance of a scrape so uncomfortable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, I am, in the first place, by no means sure
that the risk existed,&rdquo; said the Earl of Etherington;
&ldquo;for, as I have often told you, I had but a very
transient glimpse of the ruffian; and, in the second
place, I <i>am</i> sure that no permanent bad consequences
have ensued. I am too old a fox-hunter
to be afraid of a leap after it is cleared, as they tell
of the fellow who fainted in the morning at the
sight of the precipice he had clambered over when
he was drunk on the night before. The man who
wrote that letter,&rdquo; touching it with his finger, &ldquo;is
alive, and able to threaten me; and if he did come
to any hurt from my hand, it was in the act of<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_84" id="vol_ii_Page_84">[Pg&nbsp;84]</a></span>
attempting my life, of which I shall carry the mark
to my grave.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, I am far from blaming your lordship,&rdquo;
said Mowbray, &ldquo;for what you did in self-defence,
but the circumstance might have turned out very
unpleasant.&mdash;May I ask what you intend to do with
this unfortunate gentleman, who is in all probability
in the neighbourhood?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must first discover the place of his retreat,&rdquo;
said Lord Etherington, &ldquo;and then consider what is
to be done both for his safety, poor fellow, and my
own. It is probable, too, that he may find sharpers
to prey upon what fortune he still possesses,
which, I assure you, is sufficient to attract a set of
folk, who may ruin while they humour him.&mdash;May
I beg that you, too, will be on the outlook, and let
me know if you hear or see more of him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall, most certainly, my lord,&rdquo; answered
Mowbray; &ldquo;but the only one of his haunts which
I know, is the old Cleikum Inn, where he chose to
take up his residence. He has now left it, but perhaps
the old crab-fish of a landlady may know
something of him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will not fail to enquire,&rdquo; said Lord Etherington;
and, with these words, he took a kind farewell
of Mowbray, mounted his horse, and rode up the
avenue.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A cool fellow,&rdquo; said Mowbray, as he looked
after him, &ldquo;a d&mdash;d cool fellow, this brother-in-law
of mine, that is to be&mdash;takes a shot at his father's
son with as little remorse as at a blackcock&mdash;what
would he do with me, were we to quarrel?&mdash;Well,
I can snuff a candle, and strike out the ace of hearts;
and so, should things go wrong, he has no Jack
Raw to deal with, but Jack Mowbray.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_85" id="vol_ii_Page_85">[Pg&nbsp;85]</a></span></p>

<p>Meanwhile the Earl of Etherington hastened
home to his own apartments at the Hotel; and, not
entirely pleased with the events of the day, commenced
a letter to his correspondent, agent, and
confidant, Captain Jekyl, which we have fortunately
the means of presenting to our readers.&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Friend Harry</span>,&mdash;They say a falling house is best
known by the rats leaving it&mdash;a falling state, by the
desertion of confederates and allies&mdash;and a falling
man, by the desertion of his friends. If this be true
augury; your last letter may be considered as ominous
of my breaking down. Methinks, you have gone far
enough, and shared deep enough with me, to have some
confidence in my <i>savoir faire</i>&mdash;some little faith both
in my means and management. What crossgrained
fiend has at once inspired you with what I suppose you
wish me to call politic doubts and scruples of conscience,
but which I can only regard as symptoms of fear and
disaffection? You can have no idea of &lsquo;duels betwixt
relations so nearly connected&rsquo;&mdash;and &lsquo;the affair seems
very delicate and intricate&rsquo;&mdash;and again, &lsquo;the matter
has never been fully explained to you&rsquo;&mdash;and, moreover,
&lsquo;if you are expected to take an active part in the
business, it must be when you are honoured with my
full and unreserved confidence, otherwise how could you
be of the use to me which I might require?&rsquo; Such are
your expressions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, as to scruples of conscience about near
relations, and so forth, all that has blown by without
much mischief, and certainly is not likely to occur
again&mdash;besides, did you never hear of friends quarrelling
before? And are they not to exercise the usual
privileges of gentlemen when they do? Moreover, how
am I to know that this plaguy fellow <i>is</i> actually
related to me?&mdash;They say it is a wise child knows its
own father; and I cannot be expected wise enough to<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_86" id="vol_ii_Page_86">[Pg&nbsp;86]</a></span>
know to a certainty my father's son.&mdash;So much for
relationship.&mdash;Then, as to full and unreserved confidence&mdash;why,
Harry, this is just as if I were to ask
you to look at a watch, and tell what it was o'clock, and
you were to reply, that truly you could not inform me,
because you had not examined the springs, the counter-balances,
the wheels, and the whole internal machinery
of the little timepiece.&mdash;But the upshot of the whole is
this. Harry Jekyl, who is as sharp a fellow as any
other, thinks he has his friend Lord Etherington at a
dead lock, and that he knows already so much of the
said noble lord's history as to oblige his lordship to tell
him the whole. And perhaps he not unreasonably concludes,
that the custody of a whole secret is more
creditable, and probably more lucrative, than that of a
half one; and, in short,&mdash;he is resolved to make the
most of the cards in his hand. Another, mine honest
Harry, would take the trouble to recall to your mind
past times and circumstances, and conclude with
expressing a humble opinion, that if Harry Jekyl were
asked <i>now</i> to do any service for the noble lord aforesaid,
Harry had got his reward in his pocket aforehand. But
I do not argue thus, because I would rather be leagued
with a friend who assists me with a view to future profit,
than from respect to benefits already received. The
first lies like the fox's scent when on his last legs,
increasing every moment; the other is a back-scent,
growing colder the longer you follow it, until at last it
becomes impossible to puzzle it out. I will, therefore,
submit to circumstances, and tell you the whole story,
though somewhat tedious, in hopes that I can conclude
with such a trail as you will open upon breast-high.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thus then it was.&mdash;Francis, fifth Earl of Etherington,
and my much-honoured father, was what is
called a very eccentric man&mdash;that is, he was neither a
wise man nor a fool&mdash;had too much sense to walk into
a well, and yet in some of the furious fits which he was
visited with, I have seen him quite mad enough to<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_87" id="vol_ii_Page_87">[Pg&nbsp;87]</a></span>
throw any one else into it.&mdash;Men said there was a
lurking insanity&mdash;but it is an ill bird, &amp;c., and I will
say no more about it. This shatterbrained peer was, in
other respects, a handsome accomplished man, with an
expression somewhat haughty, yet singularly pleasing
when he chose it&mdash;a man, in short, who might push
his fortune with the fair sex.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lord Etherington, such as I have described him,
being upon his travels in France, formed an attachment
of the heart&mdash;ay, and some have pretended, of the
hand also, with a certain beautiful orphan, Marie de
Martigny. Of this union is said to have sprung (for I
am determined not to be certain on that point) that most
incommodious person, Francis Tyrrel, as he calls himself,
but as I would rather call him, Francis Martigny;
the latter suiting my views, as perhaps the former
name agrees better with his pretensions. Now, I am
too good a son to subscribe to the alleged regularity of
the marriage between my right honourable and very
good lord father, because my said right honourable and
very good lord did, on his return to England, become
wedded, in the face of the church, to my very affectionate
and well-endowed mother, Ann Bulmer of Bulmer-hall,
from which happy union sprung I, Francis
Valentine Bulmer Tyrrel, lawful inheritor of my father
and mother's joint estates, as I was the proud possessor of
their ancient names. But the noble and wealthy pair,
though blessed with such a pledge of love as myself,
lived mighty ill together, and the rather, when my
right honourable father, sending for this other Sosia,
this unlucky Francis Tyrrel, senior, from France,
insisted, in the face of propriety, that he should reside
in his house, and share, in all respects, in the opportunities
of education by which the real Sosia, Francis
Valentine Bulmer Tyrrel, then commonly called Lord
Oakendale, hath profited in such an uncommon
degree.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Various were the matrimonial quarrels which arose<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_88" id="vol_ii_Page_88">[Pg&nbsp;88]</a></span>
between the honoured lord and lady, in consequence
of this unseemly conjunction of the legitimate and
illegitimate; and to these, we, the subjects of the
dispute, were sometimes very properly, as well as
decorously, made the witnesses. On one occasion,
my right honourable mother, who was a free-spoken
lady, found the language of her own rank quite
inadequate to express the strength of her generous feelings,
and borrowing from the vulgar two emphatic
words, applied them to Marie de Martigny, and her son
Francis Tyrrel. Never did Earl that ever wore coronet
fly into a pitch of more uncontrollable rage, than did
my right honourable father: and in the ardour of his
reply, he adopted my mother's phraseology, to inform
her, that if there <i>was</i> a whore and bastard connected
with his house, it was herself and her brat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was even then a sharp little fellow, and was
incredibly struck with the communication, which, in
this hour of ungovernable irritation, had escaped my
right honourable father. It is true, he instantly gathered
himself up again; and, he perhaps recollecting
such a word as <i>bigamy</i>, and my mother, on her side,
considering the consequences of such a thing as a
descent from the Countess of Etherington into Mrs.
Bulmer, neither wife, maid, nor widow, there was an
apparent reconciliation between them, which lasted
for some time. But the speech remained deeply imprinted
on my remembrance; the more so, that once,
when I was exerting over my friend Francis Tyrrel,
the authority of a legitimate brother, and Lord Oakendale,
old Cecil, my father's confidential valet, was so
much scandalized, as to intimate a possibility that we
might one day change conditions. These two accidental
communications seemed to me a key to certain long
lectures, with which my father used to regale us boys,
but me in particular, upon the extreme mutability
of human affairs,&mdash;the disappointment of the best-grounded
hopes and expectations,&mdash;and the necessity<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_89" id="vol_ii_Page_89">[Pg&nbsp;89]</a></span>
of being so accomplished in all useful branches of
knowledge, as might, in case of accidents, supply any
defalcation in our rank and fortune;&mdash;as if any art or
science could make amends for the loss of an Earldom,
and twelve thousand a-year! All this prosing seemed
to my anxious mind designed to prepare me for some
unfortunate change; and when I was old enough to
make such private enquiries as lay in my power, I
became still more persuaded that my right honourable
father nourished some thoughts of making an honest
woman of Marie de Martigny, and a legitimate elder
brother of Francis, after his death at least, if not during
his life. I was the more convinced of this, when a
little affair, which I chanced to have with the daughter
of my Tu&mdash;&mdash;, drew down my father's wrath upon me
in great abundance, and occasioned my being banished
to Scotland, along with my brother, under a very poor
allowance, without introductions, except to one steady,
or call it rusty, old Professor, and with the charge
that I should not assume the title of Lord Oakendale,
but content myself with my maternal grandfather's
name of Valentine Bulmer, that of Francis Tyrrel
being pre-occupied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Upon this occasion, notwithstanding the fear
which I entertained of my father's passionate temper,
I did venture to say, that since I was to resign my
title, I thought I had a right to keep my family name,
and that my brother might take his mother's. I
wish you had seen the look of rage with which my
father regarded me when I gave him this spirited hint.
&lsquo;Thou art,&rsquo; he said, and paused, as if to find out the
bitterest epithet to supply the blank&mdash;&lsquo;thou art thy
mother's child, and her perfect picture&rsquo;&mdash;(this seemed
the severest reproach that occurred to him.)&mdash;&lsquo;Bear
her name then, and bear it with patience and in secrecy;
or, I here give you my word, you shall never bear
another the whole days of your life.&rsquo; This sealed my
mouth with a witness; and then, in allusion to my<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_90" id="vol_ii_Page_90">[Pg&nbsp;90]</a></span>
flirtation with the daughter of my Tu&mdash;&mdash; aforesaid, he
enlarged on the folly and iniquity of private marriages,
warned me that in the country I was going to, the
matrimonial noose often lies hid under flowers, and that
folks find it twitched round their neck when they least
expect such a cravat; assured me, that he had very
particular views for settling Francis and me in life, and
that he would forgive neither of us who should, by any
such rash entanglements, render them unavailing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This last minatory admonition was the more tolerable,
that my rival had his share of it; and so we were
bundled off to Scotland, coupled up like two pointers
in a dog-cart, and&mdash;I can speak for one at least&mdash;with
much the same uncordial feelings towards each other.
I often, indeed, detected Francis looking at me with a
singular expression, as of pity and anxiety, and once
or twice he seemed disposed to enter on something
respecting the situation in which we stood towards each
other; but I felt no desire to encourage his confidence.
Meantime, as we were called, by our father's directions,
not brothers, but cousins, so we came to bear
towards each other the habits of companionship, though
scarcely of friendship. What Francis thought, I know
not; for my part, I must confess, that I lay by on
the watch for some opportunity when I might mend
my own situation with my father, though at the prejudice
of my rival. And Fortune, while she seemed to
prevent such an opportunity, involved us both in one
of the strangest and most entangled mazes that her
capricious divinityship ever wove, and out of which I
am even now struggling, by sleight or force, to extricate
myself. I can hardly help wondering, even yet,
at the odd conjunction, which has produced such an
intricacy of complicated incidents.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My father was a great sportsman, and Francis and
I had both inherited his taste for field-sports; but I in
a keener and more ecstatic degree. Edinburgh, which
is a tolerable residence in winter and spring, becomes<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_91" id="vol_ii_Page_91">[Pg&nbsp;91]</a></span>
disagreeable in summer, and in autumn is the most
melancholy <i>sejour</i> that ever poor mortals were condemned
to. No public places are open, no inhabitant
of any consideration remains in the town; those who
cannot get away, hide themselves in obscure corners, as
if ashamed to be seen in the streets. The gentry go
to their country-houses&mdash;the citizens to their sea-bathing
quarters&mdash;the lawyers to their circuits&mdash;the
writers to visit their country clients&mdash;and all the
world to the moors to shoot grouse. We, who felt the
indignity of remaining in town during this deserted
season, obtained, with some difficulty, permission from
the Earl to betake ourselves to any obscure corner, and
shoot grouse, if we could get leave to do so on our
general character of English students at the University
of Edinburgh, without quoting any thing more.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The first year of our banishment we went to the
neighbourhood of the Highlands; but finding our sport
interrupted by gamekeepers and their gillies, on the
second occasion we established ourselves at this little
village of St. Ronan's, where there were then no Spa,
no fine people, no card tables, no quizzes, excepting the
old quiz of a landlady with whom we lodged. We found
the place much to our mind; the old landlady had
interest with some old fellow, agent of a non-residing
nobleman, who gave us permission to sport over his
moors, of which I availed myself keenly, and Francis
with more moderation. He was, indeed, of a grave
musing sort of habit, and often preferred solitary walks,
in the wild and beautiful scenery with which the village
is surrounded, to the use of the gun. He was attached
to fishing, moreover, that dullest of human amusements,
and this also tended to keep us considerably apart.
This gave me rather pleasure than concern;&mdash;not that
I hated Francis at that time; nay, not that I greatly
disliked his society; but merely because it was unpleasant
to be always with one, whose fortunes I looked upon
as standing in direct opposition to my own. I also<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_92" id="vol_ii_Page_92">[Pg&nbsp;92]</a></span>
rather despised the indifference about sport, which
indeed seemed to grow upon him; but my gentleman
had better taste than I was aware of. If he sought no
grouse on the hill, he had flushed a pheasant in the
wood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Clara Mowbray, daughter of the Lord of the more
picturesque than wealthy domain of St. Ronan's, was
at that time scarce sixteen years old, and as wild and
beautiful a woodland nymph as the imagination can
fancy&mdash;simple as a child in all that concerned the
world and its ways, acute as a needle in every point
of knowledge which she had found an opportunity of
becoming acquainted with; fearing harm from no one,
and with, a lively and natural strain of wit, which
brought amusement and gaiety wherever she came.
Her motions were under no restraint, save that of her
own inclination; for her father, though a cross, peevish,
old man, was confined to his chair with the gout,
and her only companion, a girl of somewhat inferior
caste, bred up in the utmost deference to Miss Mowbray's
fancies, served for company indeed in her strolls
through the wild country on foot and on horseback,
but never thought of interfering with her will and
pleasure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The extreme loneliness of the country, (at that
time,) and the simplicity of its inhabitants, seemed
to render these excursions perfectly safe. Francis,
happy dog, became the companion of the damsels on
such occasions through the following accident. Miss
Mowbray had dressed herself and her companion like
country wenches, with a view to surprise the family of
one of their better sort of farmers. They had accomplished
their purpose greatly to their satisfaction, and
were hying home after sunset, when they were encountered
by a country fellow&mdash;a sort of Harry Jekyl in
his way&mdash;who, being equipped with a glass or two of
whisky, saw not the nobility of blood through her disguise,
and accosted the daughter of a hundred sires as<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_93" id="vol_ii_Page_93">[Pg&nbsp;93]</a></span>
he would have done a ewe-milker. Miss Mowbray
remonstrated&mdash;her companion screamed&mdash;up came
cousin Francis with a fowlingpiece on his shoulder,
and soon put the sylvan to flight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This was the beginning of an acquaintance, which
had gone great lengths before I found it out. The fair
Clara, it seems, found it safer to roam in the woods with
an escort than alone, and my studious and sentimental
relative was almost her constant companion. At their
age, it was likely that some time might pass ere they
came to understand each other; but full confidence and
intimacy was established between them ere I heard of
their amour.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And here, Harry, I must pause till next morning,
and send you the conclusion under a separate cover.
The rap which I had over the elbow the other day, is
still tingling at the end of my fingers, and you must
not be critical with my manuscript.&rdquo;</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_94" id="vol_ii_Page_94">[Pg&nbsp;94]</a></span></p>

</p>


<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;I resume my pen, Harry, to mention, without
attempting to describe my surprise, that Francis,
compelled by circumstances, made me the confidant
of his love-intrigue. My grave cousin in love, and
very much in the mind of approaching the perilous
verge of clandestine marriage&mdash;he who used every
now and then, not much to the improvement of our
cordial regard, to lecture me upon filial duty, just
upon the point of slipping the bridle himself! I
could not for my life tell whether surprise, or a feeling
of mischievous satisfaction, was predominant. I
tried to talk to him as he used to talk to me; but
I had not the gift of persuasion, or he the power of
understanding the words of wisdom. He insisted our
situation was different&mdash;that his unhappy birth, as
he termed it, freed him at least from dependence on
his father's absolute will&mdash;that he had, by bequest
from some relative of his mother, a moderate competence,
which Miss Mowbray had consented to share
with him; in fine, that he desired not my counsel but
my assistance. A moment's consideration convinced
me, that I should be unkind, not to him only, but to
myself, unless I gave him all the backing I could in
this his most dutiful scheme. I recollected our right<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_95" id="vol_ii_Page_95">[Pg&nbsp;95]</a></span>
honourable father's denunciations against Scottish
marriages, and secret marriages of all sorts,&mdash;denunciations
perhaps not the less vehement, that he might
feel some secret prick of conscience on the subject himself.
I remembered that my grave brother had always
been a favourite, and I forgot not&mdash;how was it possible
I could forget&mdash;those ominous expressions, which intimated
a possibility of the hereditary estate and honours
being transferred to the elder, instead of the younger
son. Now, it required no conjurer to foresee, that
should Francis commit this inexpiable crime of
secretly allying himself with a Scottish beauty, our sire
would lose all wish to accomplish such a transference
in his favour; and while my brother's merits were
altogether obscured by such an unpardonable act of
disobedience, my own, no longer overshadowed by prejudice
or partiality, would shine forth in all their
natural brilliancy. These considerations, which flashed
on me with the rapidity of lightning, induced me to
consent to hold Frank's back-hand, during the perilous
game he proposed to play. I had only to take care that
my own share in the matter should not be so prominent
as to attract my father's attention; and this I was little
afraid of, for his wrath was usually of that vehement and
forcible character, which, like lightning, is attracted to
one single point, there bursting with violence as undivided
as it was uncontrollable.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I soon found the lovers needed my assistance more
than I could have supposed; for they were absolute
novices in any sort of intrigue, which to me seemed as
easy and natural as lying. Francis had been detected
by some tattling spy in his walks with Clara, and the
news had been carried to old Mowbray, who was greatly
incensed at his daughter, though little knowing that
her crime was greater than admitting an unknown
English student to form a personal acquaintance with
her. He prohibited farther intercourse&mdash;resolved, in
justice-of-peace phrase, to rid the country of us; and,<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_96" id="vol_ii_Page_96">[Pg&nbsp;96]</a></span>
prudently sinking all mention of his daughter's delinquency,
commenced an action against Francis, under
pretext of punishing him as an encroacher upon his
game, but in reality to scare him from the neighbourhood.
His person was particularly described to all
the keepers and satellites about Shaws-Castle, and any
personal intercourse betwixt him and Clara became
impossible, except under the most desperate risks.
Nay, such was their alarm, that Master Francis thought
it prudent, for Miss Mowbray's sake, to withdraw as
far as a town called Marchthorn, and there to conceal
himself, maintaining his intercourse with Clara only
by letter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was then I became the sheet-anchor of the hope
of the lovers; it was then my early dexterity and
powers of contrivance were first put to the test; and it
would be too long to tell you in how many shapes, and
by how many contrivances, I acted as agent, letter-carrier,
and go-between, to maintain the intercourse of
these separated turtles. I have had a good deal of
trouble in that way on my own account, but never half
so much as I took on account of this brace of lovers.
I scaled walls and swam rivers, set bloodhounds,
quarterstaves, and blunderbusses at defiance; and,
excepting the distant prospect of self-interest which
I have hinted at, I was neither to have honour nor
reward for my pains. I will own to you, that Clara
Mowbray was so very beautiful&mdash;so absolutely confiding
in her lover's friend&mdash;and thrown into such close
intercourse with me, that there were times when I
thought that, in conscience, she ought not to have
scrupled to have contributed a mite to reward the faithful
labourer. But then, she looked like purity itself;
and I was such a novice at that time of day, that I did
not know how it might have been possible for me to
retreat, if I had made too bold an advance&mdash;and, in
short, I thought it best to content myself with assisting
true love to run smooth, in the hope that its course<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_97" id="vol_ii_Page_97">[Pg&nbsp;97]</a></span>
would assure me, in the long-run, an Earl's title, and
an Earl's fortune.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing was, therefore, ventured on my part which
could raise suspicion, and, as the confidential friend of
the lovers, I prepared every thing for their secret marriage.
The pastor of the parish agreed to perform the
ceremony, prevailed upon by an argument which I used
to him, and which Clara, had she guessed it, would
have little thanked me for. I led the honest man to
believe, that, in declining to do his office, he might
prevent a too successful lover from doing justice to a
betrayed maiden; and the parson, who, I found, had a
spice of romance in his disposition, resolved, under
such pressing circumstances, to do them the kind office
of binding them together, although the consequence
might be a charge of irregularity against himself.
Old Mowbray was much confined to his room, his
daughter less watched since Frank had removed from
the neighbourhood&mdash;the brother (which, by the by, I
should have said before) not then in the country&mdash;and
it was settled that the lovers should meet at the Old
Kirk of Saint Ronan's when the twilight became deep,
and go off in a chaise for England so soon as the ceremony
was performed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When all this was arranged save the actual
appointment of the day, you cannot conceive the happiness
and the gratitude of my sage brother. He
looked upon himself as approaching to the seventh
heaven, instead of losing his chance of a good fortune,
and encumbering himself at nineteen with a wife, and
all the probabilities of narrow circumstances, and an
increasing family. Though so much younger myself,
I could not help wondering at his extreme want of
knowledge of the world, and feeling ashamed that I
had ever allowed him to take the airs of a tutor with
me; and this conscious superiority supported me
against the thrill of jealousy which always seized me
when I thought of his carrying off the beautiful prize,<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_98" id="vol_ii_Page_98">[Pg&nbsp;98]</a></span>
which, without my address, he could never have made
his own.&mdash;But at this important crisis, I had a letter
from my father, which, by some accident, had long lain
at our lodgings in Edinburgh; and then visited our
former quarters in the Highlands; again returned to
Edinburgh, and at length reached me at Marchthorn
in a most critical time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was in reply to a letter of mine, in which,
among other matters, such as good boys send to their
papas, descriptions of the country, accounts of studies,
exercises, and so forth, I had, to fill up the sheet to a
dutiful length, thrown in something about the family
of St. Ronan's, in the neighbourhood of which I was
writing. I had no idea what an effect the name would
produce on the mind of my right honourable father, but
his letter sufficiently expressed it. He charged me to
cultivate the acquaintance of Mr. Mowbray as fast and
as intimately as possible; and, if need were, to inform
him candidly of our real character and situation in life.
Wisely considering, at the same time, that his filial
admonition might be neglected if not backed by some
sufficient motive, his lordship frankly let me into the
secret of my granduncle by the mother's side, Mr. S.
Mowbray of Nettlewood's last will and testament, by
which I saw, to my astonishment and alarm, that a
large and fair estate was bequeathed to the eldest son
and heir of the Earl of Etherington, on condition of his
forming a matrimonial alliance with a lady of the house
of Mowbray, of St. Ronan's.&mdash;Mercy of Heaven! how
I stared! Here had I been making every preparation
for wedding Francis to the very girl, whose hand would
insure to myself wealth and independence!&mdash;And even
the first loss, though great, was not likely to be the last.
My father spoke of the marriage like a land-surveyor,
but of the estate of Nettlewood like an impassioned
lover. He seemed to dote on every acre of it, and
dwelt on its contiguity to his own domains as a circumstance
which rendered the union of the estates not<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_99" id="vol_ii_Page_99">[Pg&nbsp;99]</a></span>
desirable merely, but constituted an arrangement,
pointed out by the hand of nature. And although he
observed, that, on account of the youth of the parties,
treaty of marriage could not be immediately undertaken,
it was yet clear he would approve at heart of any
bold stroke which would abolish the interval of time
that might otherwise intervene, ere Oakendale and
Nettlewood became one property.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here, then, were shipwrecked my fair hopes. It
was clear as sunshine, that a private marriage, unpardonable
in the abstract, would become venial, nay,
highly laudable, in my father's eyes, if it united his
heir with Clara Mowbray; and if he really had, as my
fears suggested, the means of establishing legitimacy
on my brother's part, nothing was so likely to tempt
him to use them, as the certainty that, by his doing so,
Nettlewood and Oakendale would be united into one.
The very catastrophe which I had prepared, as sure to
exclude my rival from his father's favour, was thus
likely, unless it could be prevented, to become a strong
motive and argument for the Earl placing his rights
above mine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shut myself up in my bedroom; locked the door;
read, and again read my father's letter; and, instead of
giving way to idle passion, (beware of that, Harry, even
in the most desperate circumstances,) I considered, with
keen investigation, whether some remedy could not yet
be found.&mdash;To break off the match for the time, would
have been easy&mdash;a little private information to Mr.
Mowbray would have done that with a vengeance&mdash;But
then the treaty might be renewed under my father's
auspices;&mdash;at all events, the share which I had taken
in the intrigue between Clara and my brother, rendered
it almost impossible for me to become a suitor in my own
person.&mdash;Amid these perplexities, it suddenly occurred
to my adventurous heart and contriving brain&mdash;what
if I should personate the bridegroom?&mdash;This strange
thought, you will recollect, occurred to a very youthful<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_100" id="vol_ii_Page_100">[Pg&nbsp;100]</a></span>
brain&mdash;it was banished&mdash;it returned&mdash;returned again
and again&mdash;was viewed under every different shape&mdash;became
familiar&mdash;was adopted.&mdash;It was easy to
fix the appointment with Clara and the clergyman
for I managed the whole correspondence&mdash;the resemblance
between Francis and me in stature and in
proportion&mdash;the disguise which we were to assume&mdash;the
darkness of the church&mdash;the hurry of the
moment&mdash;might, I trusted, prevent Clara from recognising
me. To the minister I had only to say, that
though I had hitherto talked of a friend, I myself was
the happy man. My first name was Francis as well as
his; and I had found Clara so gentle, so confiding, so
flatteringly cordial in her intercourse with me, that,
once within my power, and prevented from receding by
shame, and a thousand contradictory feelings, I had,
with the vanity of an <i>amoureux de seize ans</i>, the
confidence to believe I could reconcile the fair lady to
the exchange.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There certainly never came such a thought into a
madcap's brain; and, what is more extraordinary&mdash;but
that you already know&mdash;it was so far successful, that
the marriage ceremony was performed between us in the
presence of a servant of mine, Clara's accommodating
companion, and the priest.&mdash;We got into the carriage,
and were a mile from the church, when my unlucky or
lucky brother stopped the chaise by force&mdash;through what
means he had obtained knowledge of my little trick, I
never have been able to learn. Solmes has been faithful
to me in too many instances, that I should suspect him
in this important crisis. I jumped out of the carriage,
pitched fraternity to the devil, and, betwixt desperation
and something very like shame, began to cut away with
a couteau de chasse, which I had provided in case of
necessity.&mdash;All was in vain&mdash;I was hustled down
under the wheel of the carriage, and, the horses taking
fright, it went over my body.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here ends my narrative; for I neither heard not<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_101" id="vol_ii_Page_101">[Pg&nbsp;101]</a></span>
saw more until I found myself stretched on a sick-bed
many miles from the scene of action, and Solmes
engaged in attending on me. In answer to my passionate
enquiries, he briefly informed me, that Master
Francis had sent back the young lady to her own dwelling,
and that she appeared to be extremely ill in
consequence of the alarm she had sustained. My own
health, he assured me, was considered as very precarious,
and added, that Tyrrel, who was in the same
house, was in the utmost perturbation on my account.
The very mention of his name brought on a crisis in
which I brought up much blood; and it is singular that
the physician who attended me&mdash;a grave gentleman,
with a wig&mdash;considered that this was of service to me.
I know it frightened me heartily, and prepared me for
a visit from Master Frank, which I endured with a
tameness he would not have experienced, had the usual
current of blood flowed in my veins. But sickness and
the lancet make one very tolerant of sermonizing.&mdash;At
last, in consideration of being relieved from his accursed
presence, and the sound of his infernally calm voice, I
slowly and reluctantly acquiesced in an arrangement,
by which he proposed that we should for ever bid adieu
to each other, and to Clara Mowbray. I would have
hesitated at this last stipulation. &lsquo;She was,&rsquo; I said,
&lsquo;my wife, and I was entitled to claim her as such.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This drew down a shower of most moral reproaches,
and an assurance that Clara disowned and detested my
alliance; and that where there had been an essential
error in the person, the mere ceremony could never
be accounted binding by the law of any Christian
country. I wonder this had not occurred to me; but
my ideas of marriage were much founded on plays
and novels, where such devices as I had practised are
often resorted to for winding up the plot, without
any hint of their illegality; besides, I had confided,
as I mentioned before, a little too rashly perhaps, in
my own powers of persuading so young a bride as<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_102" id="vol_ii_Page_102">[Pg&nbsp;102]</a></span>
Clara to be contented with one handsome fellow instead
of another.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Solmes took up the argument, when Francis
released me by leaving the room. He spoke of my
father's resentment, should this enterprise reach his
ears&mdash;of the revenge of Mowbray of St. Ronan's,
whose nature was both haughty and rugged&mdash;of risk
from the laws of the country, and God knows what
bugbears besides, which, at a more advanced age, I
would have laughed at. In a word, I sealed the capitulation,
vowed perpetual absence, and banished myself,
as they say in this country, forth of Scotland.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And here, Harry, observe and respect my genius.
Every circumstance was against me in this negotiation.
I had been the aggressor in the war; I was wounded,
and, it might be said, a prisoner in my antagonist's
hands; yet I could so far avail myself of Monsieur
Martigny's greater eagerness for peace, that I clogged
the treaty with a condition highly advantageous to
myself, and equally unfavourable to him.&mdash;Said Mr.
Francis Martigny was to take upon himself the burden
of my right honourable father's displeasure; and our
separation, which was certain to give immense offence,
was to be represented as his work, not as mine. I
insisted, tender-hearted, dutiful soul, as I was, that
I would consent to no measure which was to bring
down papa's displeasure. This was a <i>sine qua non</i> in
our negotiation.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Voila ce que c'est d'avoir des talens!&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>&ldquo;Monsieur Francis would, I suppose, have taken
the world on his shoulders, to have placed an eternal
separation betwixt his turtledove and the falcon who
had made so bold a pounce at her.&mdash;What he wrote
to my father, I know not; as for myself, in all duty,
I represented the bad state of my health from an accident,
and that my brother and companion having been<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_103" id="vol_ii_Page_103">[Pg&nbsp;103]</a></span>
suddenly called from me by some cause which he had
not explained, I had thought it necessary to get to
London for the best advice, and only waited his lordship's
permission to return to the paternal mansion.
This I soon received, and found, as I expected, that he
was in towering wrath against my brother for his
disobedience; and, after some time, I even had reason
to think, (as how could it be otherwise, Harry?) that,
on becoming better acquainted with the merits and
amiable manners of his apparent heir, he lost any desire
which he might formerly have entertained, of accomplishing
any change in my circumstances in relation
to the world. Perhaps the old peer turned a little
ashamed of his own conduct, and dared not aver to the
congregation of the righteous, (for he became saintly
in his latter days,) the very pretty frolics which he
seems to have been guilty of in his youth. Perhaps,
also, the death of my right honourable mother operated
in my favour, since, while she lived, my chance was
the worse&mdash;there is no saying what a man will do to
spite his wife.&mdash;Enough, he died&mdash;slept with his
right honourable fathers, and I became, without opposition,
Right Honourable in his stead.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How I have borne my new honours, thou, Harry,
and our merry set, know full well. Newmarket and
Tattersal's may tell the rest. I think I have been
as lucky as most men where luck is most prized, and
so I shall say no more on that subject.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now, Harry, I will suppose thee in a moralizing
mood; that is, I will fancy the dice have run
wrong&mdash;or your double-barrel has hung fire&mdash;or a
certain lady has looked cross&mdash;or any such weighty
cause of gravity has occurred, and you give me the
benefit of your seriousness.&mdash;&lsquo;My dear Etherington,&rsquo;
say you pithily, &lsquo;you are a precious fool!&mdash;Here you
are, stirring up a business rather scandalous in itself,
and fraught with mischief to all concerned&mdash;a business
which might sleep for ever, if you let it alone,<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_104" id="vol_ii_Page_104">[Pg&nbsp;104]</a></span>
but which is sure, like a sea-coal fire, to burst into a
flame if you go on poking it. I would like to ask your
lordship only two questions,&rsquo;&mdash;say you, with your
usual graceful attitude of adjusting your perpendicular
shirt-collar, and passing your hand over the knot of
your cravat, which deserves a peculiar place in the <i>Tietania</i><a name="vol_ii_FNanchor_A_13" id="vol_ii_FNanchor_A_13"></a><a href="#vol_ii_Footnote_A_13" class="fnanchor">[A]</a><a name="vol_ii_FNanchor_5_5" id="vol_ii_FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#vol_ii_Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>&mdash;&lsquo;only
two questions&mdash;that is, Whether
you do not repent the past, and whether you do not
fear the future?&rsquo; Very comprehensive queries, these
of yours, Harry; for they respect both the time past
and the time to come&mdash;one's whole life, in short.
However, I shall endeavour to answer them as well
as I may.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Repent the past, said you?&mdash;Yes, Harry, I think
I do repent the past&mdash;that is, not quite in the parson's
style of repentance, which resembles yours when
you have a headache, but as I would repent a hand at
cards which I had played on false principles. I should
have begun with the young lady&mdash;availed myself in a
very different manner of Monsieur Martigny's absence,
and my own intimacy with her, and thus superseded
him, if possible, in the damsel's affections. The
scheme I adopted, though there was, I think, both
boldness and dexterity in it, was that of a novice of
premature genius, who could not calculate chances. So
much for repentance.&mdash;Do I not fear the future?&mdash;Harry,
I will not cut your throat for supposing you
to have put the question, but calmly assure you, that
I never feared any thing in my life. I was born without
the sensation, I believe; at least, it is perfectly
unknown to me. When I felt that cursed wheel pass
across my breast, when I felt the pistol-ball benumb
my arm, I felt no more agitation than at the bounce
of a champagne-cork. But I would not have you think<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_105" id="vol_ii_Page_105">[Pg&nbsp;105]</a></span>
that I am fool enough to risk plague, trouble, and
danger, all of which, besides considerable expense,
I am now prepared to encounter, without some adequate
motive,&mdash;and here it is.</p>

<p>&ldquo;From various quarters, hints, rumours, and surmises
have reached me, that an attack will be made on
my rank and status in society, which can only be in
behalf of this fellow Martigny, (for I will not call him
by his stolen name of Tyrrel.) Now, this I hold to be
a breach of the paction betwixt us, by which&mdash;that is,
by that which I am determined to esteem its true meaning
and purport&mdash;he was to leave my right honourable
father and me to settle our own matters without his
interference, which amounted to a virtual resignation
of his rights, if the scoundrel ever had any. Can he
expect I am to resign my wife, and what is a better
thing, old Scrogie Mowbray's estate of Nettlewood, to
gratify the humour of a fellow who sets up claims to
my title and whole property? No, by &mdash;&mdash;! If he
assails me in a point so important, I will retaliate
upon him in one where he will feel as keenly; and that
he may depend upon.&mdash;And now, methinks, you come
upon me with a second edition of your grave remonstrances,
about family feuds, unnatural rencontres,
offence to all the feelings of all the world, et cetera,
et cetera, which you might usher in most delectably
with the old stave about brethren dwelling together in
unity. I will not stop to enquire, whether all these
delicate apprehensions are on account of the Earl of
Etherington, his safety, and his reputation; or whether
my friend Harry Jekyl be not considering how far his
own interference with such a naughty business will be
well taken at Head-quarters; and so, without pausing
on that question, I shall barely and briefly say, that
you cannot be more sensible than I am of the madness
of bringing matters to such an extremity&mdash;I have no
such intention, I assure you, and it is with no such
purpose that I invite you here.&mdash;Were I to challenge<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_106" id="vol_ii_Page_106">[Pg&nbsp;106]</a></span>
Martigny, he would refuse me the meeting; and all
less ceremonious ways of arranging such an affair are
quite old-fashioned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is true, at our first meeting, I was betrayed into
the scrape I told you of&mdash;just as you may have shot
(or shot <i>at</i>, for I think you are no downright hitter) a
hen-pheasant, when flushed within distance, by a sort
of instinctive movement, without reflecting on the
enormity you are about to commit. The truth is,
there is an ignis fatuus influence, which seems to
govern our house&mdash;it poured its wildfire through my
father's veins&mdash;it has descended to me in full vigour,
and every now and then its impulse is irresistible.
There was my enemy, and here were my pistols, was
all I had time to think about the matter. But I will
be on my guard in future, the more surety, as I cannot
receive any provocation from him; on the contrary, if
I must confess the truth, though I was willing to gloss
it a little in my first account of the matter, (like the
Gazette, when recording a defeat,) I am certain he
would never voluntarily have fired at me, and that his
pistol went off as he fell. You know me well enough
to be assured, that I will never be again in the scrape
of attacking an unresisting antagonist, were he ten
times my brother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then, as to this long tirade about hating my
brother&mdash;Harry, I do not hate him more than the
first-born of Egypt are in general hated by those
whom they exclude from entailed estates, and so
forth&mdash;not one lauded man in twenty of us that is
not hated by his younger brothers, to the extent of
wishing him quiet in his grave, as an abominable
stumbling-block in their path of life; and so far only
do I hate Monsieur Martigny. But for the rest, I
rather like him as otherwise; and would he but die,
would give my frank consent to his being canonized:
and while he lives, I am not desirous that he should be
exposed to any temptation from rank and riches, those<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_107" id="vol_ii_Page_107">[Pg&nbsp;107]</a></span>
main obstacles to the self-denying course of life, by which
the odour of sanctity is attained.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here again you break in with your impertinent
queries&mdash;If I have no purpose of quarrelling personally
with Martigny, why do I come into collision with
him at all?&mdash;why not abide by the treaty of Marchthorn,
and remain in England, without again approaching
Saint Ronan's, or claiming my maiden bride?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have I not told you, I want him to cease all
threatened attempts upon my fortune and dignity?
Have I not told you, that I want to claim my wife,
Clara Mowbray, and my estate of Nettlewood, fairly
won by marrying her?&mdash;And, to let you into the whole
secret, though Clara is a very pretty woman, yet she
goes for so little in the transaction with me, her animpassioned
bridegroom, that I hope to make some
relaxation of my rights over her the means of obtaining
the concessions which I think most important.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will not deny, that an aversion to awakening
bustle, and encountering reproach, has made me so
slow in looking after my interest, that the period will
shortly expire, within which I ought, by old Scrog
Mowbray's will, to qualify myself for becoming his
heir, by being the accepted husband of Miss Mowbray
of St. Ronan's. Time was&mdash;time is&mdash;and, if I catch
it not by the forelock as it passes, time will be no more&mdash;Nettlewood
will be forfeited&mdash;and if I have in addition
a lawsuit for my title, and for Oakendale, I run a risk
of being altogether capotted. I must, therefore, act at
all risks, and act with vigour&mdash;and this is the general
plan of my campaign, subject always to be altered
according to circumstances. I have obtained&mdash;I may
say purchased&mdash;Mowbray's consent to address his sister.
I have this advantage, that if she agrees to take me, she
will for ever put a stop to all disagreeable reports and
recollections, founded on her former conduct. In that
case I secure the Nettlewood property, and am ready to
wage war for my paternal estate. Indeed, I firmly<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_108" id="vol_ii_Page_108">[Pg&nbsp;108]</a></span>
believe, that should this happy consummation take
place, Monsieur Martigny will be too much heart-broken
to make further fight, but will e'en throw
helve after hatchet, and run to hide himself, after the
fashion of a true lover, in some desert beyond seas.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But supposing the lady has the bad taste to be
obstinate, and will none of me, I still think that her
happiness, or her peace of mind, will be as dear to
Martigny, as Gibraltar is to the Spaniards, and that
he will sacrifice a great deal to induce me to give up
my pretensions. Now, I shall want some one to act as
my agent in communicating with this fellow; for I will
not deny that my old appetite for cutting his throat
may awaken suddenly, were I to hold personal intercourse
with him. Come thou, therefore, without delay,
and hold my back-hand&mdash;Come, for you know me, and
that I never left a kindness unrewarded. To be specific,
you shall have means to pay off a certain inconvenient
mortgage, without troubling the tribe of Issachar, if
you will be but true to me in this matter&mdash;Come, therefore,
without further apologies or further delay. There
shall, I give you my word, neither be risk or offence in
the part of the drama which I intend to commit to your
charge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Talking of the drama, we had a miserable attempt
at a sort of bastard theatricals, at Mowbray's rat-gnawed
mansion. There were two things worth noticing&mdash;One,
that I lost all the courage on which I pique myself, and
fairly fled from the pit, rather than present myself before
Miss Clara Mowbray, when it came to the push. And
upon this I pray you to remark, that I am a person of
singular delicacy and modesty, instead of being the
Drawcansir and Daredevil that you would make of me.
The other memorabile is of a more delicate nature,
respecting the conduct of a certain fair lady, who
seemed determined to fling herself at my head. There
is a wonderful degree of freemasonry among us folk of
spirit; and it is astonishing how soon we can place our<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_109" id="vol_ii_Page_109">[Pg&nbsp;109]</a></span>selves
on a footing with neglected wives and discontented
daughters. If you come not soon, one of the rewards held
out to you in my former letter, will certainly not be forthcoming.
No schoolboy keeps gingerbread, for his comrade,
without feeling a desire to nibble at it; so, if you
appear not to look after your own interest, say you had
fair warning. For my own part, I am rather embarrassed
than gratified by the prospect of such an affair,
when I have on the tapis another of a different nature.
This enigma I will explain at meeting.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thus finishes my long communication. If my
motives of action do not appear explicit, think in what
a maze fortune has involved me, and how much
must necessarily depend on the chapter of accidents.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yesterday I may be said to have opened my siege,
for I presented myself before Clara. I had no very
flattering reception&mdash;that was of little consequence, for
I did not expect one. By alarming her fears, I made
an impression thus far, that she acquiesces in my
appearing before her as her brother's guest, and this is
no small point gained. She will become accustomed to
look on me, and will remember with less bitterness the
trick which I played her formerly; while I, on the other
hand, by a similar force of habit, will get over certain
awkward feelings with which I have been compunctiously
visited whenever I look upon her.&mdash;Adieu!
Health and brotherhood.</p>

<i>Old Play.</i><br />
</p>


<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;I have received your two long letters, my dear
Etherington, with equal surprise and interest; for
what I knew of your Scottish adventures before, was
by no means sufficient to prepare me for a statement so
perversely complicated. The Ignis Fatuus which, you
say, governed your father, seems to have ruled the fortunes
of your whole house, there is so much eccentricity in
all that you have told me. But <i>n'importe</i>, Etherington,
you were my friend&mdash;you held me up when I was completely
broken down; and, whatever you may think,
my services are at your command much more from
reflections on the past, than hopes for the future. I
am no speechmaker, but this you may rely on while I
continue to be Harry Jekyl. You have deserved some
love at my hands, Etherington, and you have it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I love you the better since your perplexities
have become known to me; for, my dear
Etherington, you were before too much an object of
envy to be entirely an object of affection. What a
happy fellow! was the song of all who named you.
Bank, and a fortune to maintain it&mdash;luck sufficient
to repair all the waste that you could make in your
income, and skill to back that luck, or supply it
should it for a moment fail you.&mdash;The cards turning<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_111" id="vol_ii_Page_111">[Pg&nbsp;111]</a></span>
up as if to your wish&mdash;the dice rolling, it almost
seemed, at your wink&mdash;it was rather your look than
the touch of your cue that sent the ball into the
pocket. You seemed to have fortune in chains, and
a man of less honour would have been almost suspected
of helping his luck by a little art.&mdash;You won every
bet; and the instant that you were interested, one
might have named the winning horse&mdash;it was always
that which you were to gain most by.&mdash;You never held
out your piece but the game went down&mdash;and then the
women!&mdash;with face, manners, person, and, above all,
your tongue&mdash;what wild work have you made among
them!&mdash;Good heaven! and have you had the old
sword hanging over your head by a horsehair all this
while?&mdash;Has your rank been doubtful?&mdash;Your fortune
unsettled?&mdash;And your luck, so constant in every
thing else, has that, as well as your predominant
influence with the women, failed you, when you wished
to form a connexion for life, and when the care of your
fortune required you to do so?&mdash;Etherington, I am
astonished!&mdash;The Mowbray scrape I always thought
an inconvenient one, as well as the quarrel with this
same Tyrrel, or Martigny; but I was far from guessing
the complicated nature of your perplexities.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I must not run on in a manner which, though
it relieves my own marvelling mind, cannot be very
pleasant to you. Enough, I look on my obligations to
you as more light to be borne, now I have some chance
of repaying them to a certain extent; but, even were
the full debt paid, I would remain as much attached to
you as ever. It is your friend who speaks, Etherington;
and, if he offers his advice in somewhat plain language,
do not, I entreat you, suppose that your confidence has
encouraged an offensive familiarity, but consider me as
one who, in a weighty matter, writes plainly, to avoid
the least chance of misconstruction.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Etherington, your conduct hitherto has resembled
anything rather than the coolness and judgment which<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_112" id="vol_ii_Page_112">[Pg&nbsp;112]</a></span>
are so peculiarly your own when you choose to display
them. I pass over the masquerade of your marriage&mdash;it
was a boy's trick, which could hardly have availed you
much, even if successful; for what sort of a wife would
you have acquired, had this same Clara Mowbray proved
willing to have accepted the change which you had put
upon her, and transferred herself, without repugnance,
from one bridegroom to another?&mdash;Poor as I am, I
know that neither Nettlewood nor Oakendale should
have bribed me to marry such a &mdash;&mdash; I cannot decorously
fill up the blank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Neither, my dear Etherington, can I forgive you
the trick you put on the clergyman, in whose eyes you
destroyed the poor girl's character to induce him to
consent to perform the ceremony, and have thereby perhaps
fixed an indelible stain on her for life&mdash;this was
not a fair <i>ruse de guerre</i>.&mdash;As it is, you have taken
little by your stratagem&mdash;unless, indeed, it should be
difficult for the young lady to prove the imposition put
upon her&mdash;for that being admitted, the marriage certainly
goes for nothing. At least, the only use you
can make of it, would be to drive her into a more formal
union, for fear of having this whole unpleasant
discussion brought into a court of law; and in this,
with all the advantages you possess, joined to your
own arts of persuasion, and her brother's influence, I
should think you very likely to succeed. All women
are necessarily the slaves of their reputation. I have
known some who have given up their virtue to preserve
their character, which is, after all, only the shadow of
it. I therefore would not conceive it difficult for Clara
Mowbray to persuade herself to become a countess,
rather than be the topic of conversation for all Britain,
while a lawsuit betwixt you is in dependence; and that
may be for the greater part of both your lives.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, in Miss Mowbray's state of mind, it may
require time to bring her to such a conclusion; and I
fear you will be thwarted in your operations by your<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_113" id="vol_ii_Page_113">[Pg&nbsp;113]</a></span>
rival&mdash;I will not offend you by calling him your
brother. Now, it is here that I think with pleasure
I may be of some use to you,&mdash;under this special condition,
that there shall be no thoughts of farther
violence taking place between you. However you may
have smoothed over your rencontre to yourself, there is
no doubt that the public would have regarded any accident
which might have befallen on that occasion, as a
crime of the deepest dye, and that the law would have
followed it with the most severe punishment. And for
all that I have said of my serviceable disposition, I would
fain stop short on this side of the gallows&mdash;my neck
is too long already. Without a jest, Etherington, you
must be ruled by counsel in this matter. I detect your
hatred to this man in every line of your letter, even
when you write with the greatest coolness; even where
there is an affectation of gaiety, I read your sentiments
on this subject; and they are such as&mdash;I will not
preach to you&mdash;I will not say a good man&mdash;but such
as every wise man&mdash;every man who wishes to live on
fair terms with the world, and to escape general malediction,
and perhaps a violent death, where all men
will clap their hands and rejoice at the punishment of
the fratricide,&mdash;would, with all possible speed, eradicate
from his breast. My services therefore, if they
are worth your acceptance, are offered on the condition
that this unholy hatred be subdued with the utmost
force of your powerful mind, and that you avoid every
thing which can possibly lead to such a catastrophe as
you have twice narrowly escaped. I do not ask you to
like this man, for I know well the deep root which your
prejudices hold in your mind; I merely ask you to avoid
him, and to think of him as one, who, if you do meet
him, can never be the object of personal resentment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;On these conditions, I will instantly join you at
your Spa, and wait but your answer to throw myself
into the post-chaise. I will seek out this Martigny for
you, and I have the vanity to think I shall be able<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_114" id="vol_ii_Page_114">[Pg&nbsp;114]</a></span>
to persuade him to take the course which his own true
interest, as well as yours, so plainly points out&mdash;and
that is, to depart and make us free of him. You must
not grudge a round sum of money, should that prove
necessary&mdash;we must make wings for him to fly with,
and I must be empowered by you to that purpose. I
cannot think you have any thing serious to fear from a
lawsuit. Your father threw out this sinister hint at a
moment when he was enraged at his wife, and irritated
by his son; and I have little doubt that his expressions
were merely flashes of anger at the moment, though
I see they have made a deep impression on you. At
all events, he spoke of a preference to his illegitimate
son, as something which it was in his own power to
give or to withhold; and he has died without bestowing
it. The family seem addicted to irregular matrimony,
and some left-handed marriage there may have been
used to propitiate the modesty, and save the conscience,
of the French lady; but, that any thing of the nature
of a serious and legal ceremony took place, nothing but
the strongest proof can make me believe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I repeat, then, that I have little doubt that the
claims of Martigny, whatever they are, may be easily
compounded, and England made clear of him. This
will be more easily done, if he really entertains such a
romantic passion, as you describe, for Miss Clara Mowbray.
It would be easy to show him, that whether she
is disposed to accept your lordship's hand or not, her
quiet and peace of mind must depend on his leaving the
country. Rely on it, I shall find out the way to
smooth him down, and whether distance or the grave
divide Martigny and you, is very little to the purpose;
unless in so far as the one point can be attained with
honour and safety, and the other, if attempted, would
only make all concerned the subject of general execration
and deserved punishment.&mdash;Speak the word, and
I attend you, as your truly grateful and devoted</p>

<p style="text-align: right;">
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Henry Jekyl</span>.&rdquo;<br />
</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_115" id="vol_ii_Page_115">[Pg&nbsp;115]</a></span></p>

<p>To this admonitory epistle, the writer received,
in the course of post, the following answer:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;My truly grateful and devoted Henry Jekyl has
adopted a tone, which seems to be exalted without any
occasion. Why, thou suspicious monitor, have I not
repeated a hundred times that I repent sincerely of
the foolish rencontre, and am determined to curb my
temper, and be on my guard in future&mdash;And what
need you come upon me, with your long lesson about
execration, and punishment, and fratricide, and so
forth?&mdash;You deal with an argument as a boy does
with the first hare he shoots, which he never thinks
dead till he has fired the second barrel into her. What
a fellow you would have been for a lawyer! how long
you would have held forth upon the plainest cause,
until the poor bothered judge was almost willing to
decide against justice, that he might be revenged on
you. If I must repeat what I have said twenty times,
I tell you I have no thoughts of proceeding with this
fellow as I would with another. If my father's blood
be in his veins, it shall save the skin his mother gave
him. And so come, without more parade, either of
stipulation or argument. Thou art, indeed, a curious
animal! One would think, to read your communication,
that you had yourself discovered the propriety of acting
as a negotiator, and the reasons which might, in
the course of such a treaty, be urged with advantage
to induce this fellow to leave the country&mdash;Why, this
is the very course chalked out in my last letter! You
are bolder than the boldest gipsy, for you not only
steal my ideas, and disfigure them that they may pass
for yours, but you have the assurance to come a-begging
with them to the door of the original parent! No
man like you for stealing other men's inventions, and
cooking them up in your own way. However, Harry,
bating a little self-conceit and assumption, thou art as
honest a fellow as ever man put faith in&mdash;clever, too,<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_116" id="vol_ii_Page_116">[Pg&nbsp;116]</a></span>
in your own style, though not quite the genius you
would fain pass for.&mdash;Come on thine own terms, and
come as speedily as thou canst. I do not reckon the
promise I made the less binding, that you very generously
make no allusion to it.</p>

<p style="text-align: right;">
<span style="margin-right: 8em;">&ldquo;Thine,<br /></span>
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Etherington</span>.<br />
</p>

<p>&ldquo;P.S. One single caution I must add&mdash;do not
mention my name to any one at Harrowgate, or your
prospect of meeting me, or the route which you are
about to take. On the purpose of your journey, it is
unnecessary to recommend silence. I know not whether
such doubts are natural to all who have secret measures
to pursue, or whether nature has given me an unusual
share of anxious suspicion; but I cannot divest myself
of the idea, that I am closely watched by some one
whom I cannot discover. Although I concealed my
purpose of coming hither from all mankind but you,
whom I do not for an instant suspect of blabbing, yet
it was known to this Martigny, and he is down here
before me. Again, I said not a word&mdash;gave not a
hint to any one of my views towards Clara, yet the
tattling people here had spread a report of a marriage
depending between us, even before I could make the
motion to her brother. To be sure, in such society
there is nothing talked of but marrying and giving
in marriage; and this, which alarms me, as connected
with my own private purposes, may be a bare rumour,
arising out of the gossip of the place&mdash;Yet I feel
like the poor woman in the old story, who felt herself
watched by an eye that glared upon her from
behind the tapestry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should have told you in my last, that I had been
recognised at a public entertainment by the old clergyman,
who pronounced the matrimonial blessing on
Clara and me, nearly eight years ago. He insisted
upon addressing me by the name of Valentine Bulmer,<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_117" id="vol_ii_Page_117">[Pg&nbsp;117]</a></span>
under which I was then best known. It did not suit
me at present to put him into my confidence, so I cut
him, Harry, as I would an old pencil. The task was
the less difficult, that I had to do with one of the most
absent men that ever dreamed with his eyes open. I
verily believe he might be persuaded that the whole
transaction was a vision, and that he had never in
reality seen me before. Your pious rebuke, therefore,
about what I told him formerly concerning the lovers,
is quite thrown away. After all, if what I said was
not accurately true, as I certainly believe it was an
exaggeration, it was all Saint Francis of Martigny's
fault, I suppose. I am sure he had love and opportunity
on his side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here you have a postscript, Harry, longer than
the letter, but it must conclude with the same burden&mdash;Come,
and come quickly.&rdquo;</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_118" id="vol_ii_Page_118">[Pg&nbsp;118]</a></span></p>

</div></div>


<p>It had been settled by all who took the matter
into consideration, that the fidgety, fiery, old Nabob
would soon quarrel with his landlady, Mrs. Dods, and
become impatient of his residence at St. Ronan's.
A man so kind to himself, and so inquisitive about
the affairs of others, could have, it was supposed,
a limited sphere for gratification either of his tastes or
of his curiosity, in the Aultoun of St. Ronan's: and
many a time the precise day and hour of his departure
were fixed by the idlers at the Spa. But still
old Touchwood appeared amongst them when the
weather permitted, with his nut-brown visage, his
throat carefully wrapped up in an immense Indian
kerchief, and his gold-headed cane, which he never
failed to carry over his shoulder; his short, but
stout limbs, and his active step, showing plainly
that he bore it rather as a badge of dignity than a
means of support. There he stood, answering
shortly and gruffly to all questions proposed to him,
and making his remarks aloud upon the company,
with great indifference as to the offence which<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_119" id="vol_ii_Page_119">[Pg&nbsp;119]</a></span>
plight be taken; and as soon as the ancient priestess
had handed him his glass of the salutiferous water,
turned on his heel with a brief good-morning, and
either marched back to hide himself in the Manse,
with his crony Mr. Cargill, or to engage in
some hobby-horsical pursuit connected with his
neighbours in the Aultoun.</p>

<p>The truth was, that the honest gentleman having,
so far as Mrs. Dods would permit, put matters to
rights within her residence, wisely abstained from
pushing his innovations any farther, aware that it
is not every stone which is capable of receiving the
last degree of polish. He next set himself about
putting Mr. Cargill's house into order; and without
leave asked or given by that reverend gentleman,
he actually accomplished as wonderful a reformation
in the Manse, as could have been effected by a
benevolent Brownie. The floors were sometimes
swept&mdash;the carpets were sometimes shaken&mdash;the
plates and dishes were cleaner&mdash;there was tea and
sugar in the tea-chest, and a joint of meat at proper
times was to be found in the larder. The elder
maid-servant wore a good stuff gown&mdash;the younger
snooded up her hair, and now went about the house
a damsel so trig and neat, that some said she was
too handsome for the service of a bachelor divine;
and others, that they saw no business so old a fool
as the Nabob had to be meddling with a lassie's
busking. But for such evil bruits Mr. Touchwood
cared not, even if he happened to hear of them,
which was very doubtful. Add to all these
changes, that the garden was weeded, and the
glebe was regularly laboured.</p>

<p>The talisman by which all this desirable alteration
was wrought, consisted partly in small presents,<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_120" id="vol_ii_Page_120">[Pg&nbsp;120]</a></span>
partly in constant attention. The liberality of the
singular old gentleman gave him a perfect right to
scold when he saw things wrong; the domestics,
who had fallen into total sloth and indifference,
began to exert themselves under Mr. Touchwood's
new system of rewards and surveillance; and the
minister, half unconscious of the cause, reaped the
advantage of the exertions of his busy friend.
Sometimes he lifted his head, when he heard workmen
thumping and bouncing in the neighbourhood
of his study, and demanded the meaning of the
clatter which annoyed him; but on receiving for
answer that it was by order of Mr. Touchwood, he
resumed his labours, under the persuasion that all
was well.</p>

<p>But even the Augean task of putting the Manse
in order, did not satisfy the gigantic activity of Mr.
Touchwood. He aspired to universal dominion in
the Aultoun of St. Ronan's; and, like most men of
an ardent temper, he contrived, in a great measure,
to possess himself of the authority which he longed
after. Then was there war waged by him with all
the petty, but perpetual nuisances, which infest a
Scottish town of the old stamp&mdash;then was the hereditary
dunghill, which had reeked before the window
of the cottage for fourscore years, transported behind
the house&mdash;then was the broken wheelbarrow, or
unserviceable cart, removed out of the footpath&mdash;the
old hat, or blue petticoat, taken from the window
into which it had been stuffed, to &ldquo;expel the winter's
flaw,&rdquo; was consigned to the gutter, and its place
supplied by good perspicuous glass. The means by
which such reformation was effected, were the same
as resorted to in the Manse&mdash;money and admonition.
The latter given alone would have met little<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_121" id="vol_ii_Page_121">[Pg&nbsp;121]</a></span>
attention&mdash;perhaps would have provoked opposition&mdash;but,
softened and sweetened by a little present to
assist the reform recommended, it sunk into the
hearts of the hearers, and in general overcame their
objections. Besides, an opinion of the Nabob's
wealth was high among the villagers; and an idea
prevailed amongst them, that, notwithstanding his
keeping no servants or equipage, he was able to
purchase, if he pleased, half the land in the country.
It was not grand carriages and fine liveries that
made heavy purses, they rather helped to lighten
them; and they said, who pretended to know what
they were talking about, that old Turnpenny, and
Mr. Bindloose to boot, would tell down more money
on Mr. Touchwood's mere word, than upon the joint
bond of half the fine folk at the Well. Such an
opinion smoothed every thing before the path of one,
who showed himself neither averse to give nor to
lend; and it by no means diminished the reputation
of his wealth, that in transactions of business he was
not carelessly negligent of his interest, but plainly
showed he understood the value of what he was
parting with. Few, therefore, cared to withstand
the humours of a whimsical old gentleman, who had
both the will and the means of obliging those disposed
to comply with his fancies; and thus the
singular stranger contrived, in the course of a brief
space of days or weeks, to place the villagers more
absolutely at his devotion, than they had been to
the pleasure of any individual since their ancient
lords had left the Aultoun. The power of the baron-bailie
himself, though the office was vested in the
person of old Meiklewham, was a subordinate jurisdiction,
compared to the voluntary allegiance which
the inhabitants paid to Mr. Touchwood.<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_122" id="vol_ii_Page_122">[Pg&nbsp;122]</a></span></p>

<p>There were, however, recusants, who declined
the authority thus set up amongst them, and, with
the characteristic obstinacy of their countrymen,
refused to hearken to the words of the stranger,
whether they were for good or for evil. These
men's dunghills were not removed, nor the stumbling-blocks
taken from the footpath, where it
passed the front of their houses. And it befell, that
while Mr. Touchwood was most eager in abating
the nuisances of the village, he had very nearly
experienced a frequent fate of great reformers&mdash;that
of losing his life by means of one of those enormities
which as yet had subsisted in spite of all his
efforts.</p>

<p>The Nabob finding his time after dinner hang
somewhat heavy on his hand, and the moon being
tolerably bright, had, one harvest evening, sought
his usual remedy for dispelling ennui by a walk to
the Manse, where he was sure, that, if he could not
succeed in engaging the minister himself in some
disputation, he would at least find something in the
establishment to animadvert upon and to restore to
order.</p>

<p>Accordingly, he had taken the opportunity to
lecture the younger of the minister's lasses upon
the duty of wearing shoes and stockings; and, as
his advice came fortified by a present of six pair of
white cotton hose, and two pair of stout leathern
shoes, it was received, not with respect only, but
with gratitude, and the chuck under the chin that
rounded up the oration, while she opened the outer
door for his honour, was acknowledged with a blush
and a giggle. Nay, so far did Grizzy carry her sense
of Mr. Touchwood's kindness, that, observing the
moon was behind a cloud, she very carefully offered<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_123" id="vol_ii_Page_123">[Pg&nbsp;123]</a></span>
to escort him to the Cleikum Inn with a lantern, in
case he should come to some harm by the gate.
This the traveller's independent spirit scorned to
listen to; and, having briefly assured her that he
had walked the streets of Paris and of Madrid whole
nights without such an accommodation, he stoutly
strode off on his return to his lodgings.</p>

<p>An accident, however, befell him, which, unless
the police of Madrid and Paris be belied, might have
happened in either of those two splendid capitals,
as well as in the miserable Aultoun of St. Ronan's.
Before the door of Saunders Jaup, a feuar of some
importance, &ldquo;who held his land free, and caredna
a bodle for any one,&rdquo; yawned that odoriferous gulf,
ycleped, in Scottish phrase, the jawhole; in other
words, an uncovered common sewer. The local
situation of this receptacle of filth was well known
to Mr. Touchwood; for Saunders Jaup was at the
very head of those who held out for the practices
of their fathers, and still maintained those ancient
and unsavoury customs which our traveller had in
so many instances succeeded in abating. Guided,
therefore, by his nose, the Nabob made a considerable
circuit to avoid the displeasure and danger of
passing this filthy puddle at the nearest, and by
that means fell upon Scylla as he sought to avoid
Charybdis. In plain language, he approached so
near the bank of a little rivulet, which in that place
passed betwixt the footpath and the horse-road,
that he lost his footing, and fell into the channel
of the streamlet from a height of three or four
feet. It was thought that the noise of his fall, or
at least his call for assistance, must have been heard
in the house of Saunders Jaup; but that honest
person was, according to his own account, at that<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_124" id="vol_ii_Page_124">[Pg&nbsp;124]</a></span>
time engaged in the exercise of the evening; an
excuse which passed current, although Saunders
was privately heard to allege, that the town would
have been the quieter, &ldquo;if the auld, meddling busybody
had bidden still in the burn for gude and a'.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Fortune had provided better for poor Touchwood,
whose foibles, as they arose out of the most
excellent motives, would have ill deserved so severe
a fate. A passenger, who heard him shout for help,
ventured cautiously to the side of the bank, down
which he had fallen; and, after ascertaining the
nature of the ground as carefully as the darkness
permitted, was at length, and not without some
effort, enabled to assist him out of the channel of
the rivulet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you hurt materially?&rdquo; said this good
Samaritan to the object of his care.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;no&mdash;d&mdash;n it&mdash;no,&rdquo; said Touchwood,
extremely angry at his disaster, and the cause of it.
&ldquo;Do you think I, who have been at the summit of
Mount Athos, where the precipice sinks a thousand
feet on the sea, care a farthing about such a fall
as this is?&rdquo;</p>

<p>But, as he spoke, he reeled, and his kind assistant
caught him by the arm to prevent his falling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I fear you are more hurt than you suppose, sir,&rdquo;
said the stranger: &ldquo;permit me to go home along
with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;With all my heart,&rdquo; said Touchwood; &ldquo;for
though it is impossible I can need help in such a
foolish matter, yet I am equally obliged to you,
friend; and if the Cleikum Inn be not out of your
road, I will take your arm so far, and thank you to
the boot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is much at your service, sir,&rdquo; said the stranger;<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_125" id="vol_ii_Page_125">[Pg&nbsp;125]</a></span>
&ldquo;indeed, I was thinking to lodge there for the
night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am glad to hear it,&rdquo; resumed Touchwood;
&ldquo;you shall be my guest, and I will make them
look after you in proper fashion&mdash;You seem to be a
very civil sort of fellow, and I do not find your arm
inconvenient&mdash;it is the rheumatism makes me walk
so ill&mdash;the pest of all that have been in hot climates
when they settle among these d&mdash;d fogs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lean as hard and walk as slow as you will,
sir,&rdquo; said the benevolent assistant&mdash;&ldquo;this is a
rough street.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir&mdash;and why is it rough?&rdquo; answered
Touchwood. &ldquo;Why, because the old pig-headed
fool, Saunders Jaup, will not allow it to be made
smooth. There he sits, sir, and obstructs all
rational improvement; and, if a man would not fall
into his infernal putrid gutter, and so become an
abomination to himself and odious to others, for his
whole life to come, he runs the risk of breaking his
neck, as I have done to-night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am afraid, sir,&rdquo; said his companion, &ldquo;you
have fallen on the most dangerous side.&mdash;You
remember Swift's proverb, &lsquo;The more dirt, the less
hurt.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But why should there be either dirt or hurt in
a well-regulated place?&rdquo; answered Touchwood&mdash;&ldquo;Why
should not men be able to go about their
affairs at night, in such a hamlet as this, without
either endangering necks or noses?&mdash;Our Scottish
magistrates are worth nothing, sir&mdash;nothing at all.
Oh for a Turkish Cadi, now, to trounce the scoundrel&mdash;or
the Mayor of Calcutta to bring him into
his court&mdash;or were it but an English Justice of the
Peace that is newly included in the commission,<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_126" id="vol_ii_Page_126">[Pg&nbsp;126]</a></span>
they would abate the villain's nuisance with a vengeance
on him!&mdash;But here we are&mdash;this is the
Cleikum Inn.&mdash;Hallo&mdash;hilloa&mdash;house!&mdash;Eppie
Anderson!&mdash;Beenie Chambermaid!&mdash;boy Boots!&mdash;Mrs.
Dods!&mdash;are you all of you asleep and
dead?&mdash;Here have I been half murdered, and you
let me stand bawling at the door!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Eppie Anderson came with a light, and so did
Beenie Chambermaid with another; but no sooner
did they look upon the pair who stood in the porch
under the huge sign that swung to and fro with
heavy creaking, than Beenie screamed, flung away
her candle, although a four in the pound, and in a
newly japanned candlestick, and fled one way, while
Eppie Anderson, echoing the yell, brandished her
light round her head like a Bacchante flourishing
her torch, and ran off in another direction.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay&mdash;I must be a bloody spectacle,&rdquo; said Mr.
Touchwood, letting himself fall heavily upon his
assistant's shoulder, and wiping his face, which
trickled with wet&mdash;&ldquo;I did not think I had been
so seriously hurt; but I find my weakness now&mdash;I
must have lost much blood.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope you are still mistaken,&rdquo; said the stranger;
&ldquo;but here lies the way to the kitchen&mdash;we
shall find light there, since no one chooses to bring
it to us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He assisted the old gentleman into the kitchen,
where a lamp, as well as a bright fire, was burning,
by the light of which he could easily discern that
the supposed blood was only water of the rivulet,
and, indeed, none of the cleanest, although much
more so than the sufferer would have found it a
little lower, where the stream is joined by the superfluities
of Saunders Jaup's palladium. Relieved<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_127" id="vol_ii_Page_127">[Pg&nbsp;127]</a></span>
by his new friend's repeated assurances that such
was the case, the Senior began to bustle up a little,
and his companion, desirous to render him every
assistance, went to the door of the kitchen to call for
a basin and water. Just as he was about to open
the door, the voice of Mrs. Dods was heard as she
descended the stairs, in a tone of indignation by no
means unusual to her, yet mingled at the same time
with a few notes that sounded like unto the quaverings
of consternation.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 800px;">
<img src="images/illus-2_127.jpg" width="800" height="523" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Idle limmers&mdash;silly sluts&mdash;I'll warrant nane o'
ye will ever see ony thing waur than yoursell, ye
silly tawpies&mdash;Ghaist, indeed!&mdash;I'll warrant it's
some idle dub-skelper frae the Waal, coming after
some o' yoursells on nae honest errand&mdash;Ghaist,
indeed!&mdash;Haud up the candle, John Ostler&mdash;I'se
warrant it a twa-handed ghaist, and the door left
on the sneck. There's somebody in the kitchen&mdash;gang
forward wi' the lantern, John Ostler.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this critical moment the stranger opened the
door of the kitchen, and beheld the Dame advancing
at the head of her household troops. The
ostler and humpbacked postilion, one bearing a
stable-lantern and a hay-fork, the other a rushlight
and a broom, constituted the advanced guard; Mrs.
Dods herself formed the centre, talking loud and
brandishing a pair of tongs; while the two maids,
like troops not to be much trusted after their
recent defeat, followed, cowering in the rear. But
notwithstanding this admirable disposition, no sooner
had the stranger shown his face, and pronounced
the words &ldquo;Mrs. Dods!&rdquo; than a panic seized the
whole array. The advanced guard recoiled in consternation,
the ostler upsetting Mrs. Dods in the
confusion of his retreat; while she, grappling with<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_128" id="vol_ii_Page_128">[Pg&nbsp;128]</a></span>
him in her terror, secured him by the ears and hair,
and they joined their cries together in hideous
chorus. The two maidens resumed their former
flight, and took refuge in the darksome den, entitled
their bedroom, while the humpbacked postilion
fled like the wind into the stable, and, with professional
instinct, began, in the extremity of his
terror, to saddle a horse.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the guest whose appearance had
caused this combustion, plucked the roaring ostler
from above Mrs. Dods, and pushing him away with
a hearty slap on the shoulder, proceeded to raise
and encourage the fallen landlady, enquiring, at the
same time, &ldquo;What, in the devil's name, was the
cause of all this senseless confusion?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what is the reason, in Heaven's name,&rdquo;
answered the matron, keeping her eyes firmly shut,
and still shrewish in her expostulation, though in
the very extremity of terror, &ldquo;what is the reason
that you should come and frighten a decent house,
where you met naething, when ye was in the body,
but the height of civility?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And why should I frighten you, Mrs. Dods?
or, in one word, what is the meaning of all this
nonsensical terror?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are not you,&rdquo; said Mrs. Dods, opening her
eyes a little as she spoke, &ldquo;the ghaist of Francis
Tirl?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am Francis Tyrrel, unquestionably, my old
friend.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I kend it! I kend it!&rdquo; answered the honest
woman, relapsing into her agony; &ldquo;and I think
ye might be ashamed of yourself, that are a ghaist,
and have nae better to do than to frighten a puir
auld alewife.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_129" id="vol_ii_Page_129">[Pg&nbsp;129]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;On my word, I am no ghost, but a living man,&rdquo;
answered Tyrrel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Were ye no murdered than?&rdquo; demanded Mrs. Dods,
still in an uncertain voice, and only partially opening
her eyes&mdash;&ldquo;Are ye very sure ye werena murdered?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, not that ever I heard of, certainly,
dame,&rdquo; replied Tyrrel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But <i>I</i> shall be murdered presently,&rdquo; said old
Touchwood from the kitchen, where he had hitherto
remained a mute auditor of this extraordinary
scene&mdash;&ldquo;<i>I</i> shall be murdered, unless you fetch me
some water without delay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Coming, sir, coming,&rdquo; answered Dame Dods,
her professional reply being as familiar to her as
that of poor Francis's &ldquo;Anon, anon, sir.&rdquo; &ldquo;As I
live by honest reckonings,&rdquo; said she, fully collecting
herself, and giving a glance of more composed
temper at Tyrrel, &ldquo;I believe it <i>is</i> yoursell, Maister
Frank, in blood and body after a'&mdash;And see if
I dinna gie a proper sorting to yon twa silly jauds
that gard me mak a bogle of you, and a fule of
mysell&mdash;Ghaists! my certie, I sall ghaist them&mdash;If
they had their heads as muckle on their wark as
on their daffing, they wad play nae sic pliskies&mdash;it's
the wanton steed that scaurs at the windle-strae&mdash;Ghaists!
wha e'er heard of ghaists in an honest
house? Naebody need fear bogles that has a conscience
void of offence.&mdash;But I am blithe that
MacTurk hasna murdered ye when a' is done,
Maister Francie.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come this way, Mother Dods, if you would not
have me do a mischief!&rdquo; exclaimed Touchwood,
grasping a plate which stood on the dresser, as if
he were about to heave it at the landlady, by way
of recalling her attention.<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_130" id="vol_ii_Page_130">[Pg&nbsp;130]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;For the love of Heaven, dinna break it!&rdquo;
exclaimed the alarmed landlady, knowing that
Touchwood's effervescence of impatience sometimes
expended itself at the expense of her crockery,
though it was afterwards liberally atoned for.
&ldquo;Lord, sir, are ye out of your wits!&mdash;it breaks a
set, ye ken&mdash;Godsake, put doun the cheeny plate,
and try your hand on the delf-ware!&mdash;it will just
make as good a jingle&mdash;But, Lord haud a grip o'
us! now I look at ye, what can hae come ower ye,
and what sort of a plight are ye in!&mdash;Wait till I
fetch water and a towel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In fact, the miserable guise of her new lodger
now overcame the dame's curiosity to enquire after
the fate of her earlier acquaintance, and she gave
her instant and exclusive attention to Mr. Touchwood,
with many exclamations, while aiding him to
perform the task of ablution and abstersion. Her two
fugitive handmaidens had by this time returned to
the kitchen, and endeavoured to suppress a smuggled
laugh at the recollection of their mistress's panic, by
acting very officiously in Mr. Touchwood's service.
By dint of washing and drying, the token of the
sable stains was at length removed, and the veteran
became, with some difficulty, satisfied that he had
been more dirtied and frightened than hurt.</p>

<p>Tyrrel, in the meantime, stood looking on with
wonder, imagining that he beheld in the features
which emerged from a mask of mud, the countenance
of an old friend. After the operation was
ended, he could not help addressing himself to Mr.
Touchwood, to demand whether he had not the
pleasure to see a friend, to whom he had been
obliged when at Smyrna, for some kindness respecting
his money matters?<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_131" id="vol_ii_Page_131">[Pg&nbsp;131]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Not worth speaking of&mdash;not worth speaking
of,&rdquo; said Touchwood, hastily. &ldquo;Glad to see you,
though&mdash;glad to see you.&mdash;Yes, here I am; you
will find me the same good-natured old fool that I
was at Smyrna&mdash;never look how I am to get in
money again&mdash;always laying it out. Never mind&mdash;it
was written in my forehead, as the Turk says.&mdash;I
will go up now and change my dress&mdash;you
will sup with me when I come back&mdash;Mrs. Dods
will toss us up something&mdash;a brandered fowl will
be best, Mrs. Dods, with some mushrooms, and get
us a jug of mulled wine&mdash;plottie, as you call it&mdash;to
put the recollection of the old Presbyterian's
common sewer out of my head.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So saying, up stairs marched the traveller to his
own apartment, while Tyrrel, seizing upon a candle,
was about to do the same.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Touchwood is in the blue room, Mrs. Dods;
I suppose I may take possession of the yellow one?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Suppose naething about the matter, Maister
Francis Tirl, till ye tell me downright where ye
have been a' this time, and whether ye hae been
murdered or no?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think you may be pretty well satisfied of
that, Mrs. Dods?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Trot! and so I am in a sense; and yet it gars
me grue to look upon ye, sae mony days and weeks
it has been since I thought ye were rotten in the
moulds. And now to see ye standing before me
hale and feir, and crying for a bedroom like ither
folk!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;One would almost suppose, my good friend,&rdquo;
said Tyrrel, &ldquo;that you were sorry at my having
come alive again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It's no for that,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Dods, who was<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_132" id="vol_ii_Page_132">[Pg&nbsp;132]</a></span>
peculiarly ingenious in the mode of framing and
stating what she conceived to be her grievances;
&ldquo;but is it no a queer thing for a decent man like
yoursell, Maister Tirl, to be leaving your lodgings
without a word spoken, and me put to a' these
charges in seeking for your dead body, and very
near taking my business out of honest Maister
Bindloose's hands, because he kend the cantrips of
the like of you better than I did?&mdash;And than they
hae putten up an advertisement down at the Waal
yonder, wi' a' their names at it, setting ye forth,
Maister Francie, as are of the greatest blackguards
unhanged; and wha, div ye think, is to keep
ye in a creditable house, if that's the character ye
get?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may leave that to me, Mrs. Dods&mdash;I
assure you that matter shall be put to rights to
your satisfaction; and I think, so long as we have
known each other, you may take my word that I
am not undeserving the shelter of your roof for a
single night, (I shall ask it no longer,) until my
character is sufficiently cleared. It was for that
purpose chiefly I came back again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Came back again!&rdquo; said Mrs. Dods.&mdash;&ldquo;I profess
ye made me start, Maister Tirl, and you looking
sae pale, too.&mdash;But I think,&rdquo; she added, straining
after a joke, &ldquo;if ye were a ghaist, seeing we are such
auld acquaintance, ye wadna wish to spoil my custom,
but would just walk decently up and down the
auld castle wa's, or maybe down at the kirk yonder&mdash;there
have been awfu' things done in that kirk
and kirkyard&mdash;I whiles dinna like to look that
way, Maister Francie.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am much of your mind, mistress,&rdquo; said Tyrrel,
with a sigh; &ldquo;and, indeed, I do in one<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_133" id="vol_ii_Page_133">[Pg&nbsp;133]</a></span>
resemble the apparitions you talk of; for, like them,
and to as little purpose, I stalk about scenes where
my happiness departed.&mdash;But I speak riddles to
you, Mrs. Dods&mdash;the plain truth is, that I met
with an accident on the day I last left your house,
the effects of which detained me at some distance
from St. Ronan's till this very day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hegh, sirs, and ye were sparing of your trouble,
that wadna write a bit line, or send a bit message!&mdash;Ye
might hae thought folk wad hae been vexed
eneugh about ye, forby undertaking journeys, and
hiring folk to seek for your dead body.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall willingly pay all reasonable charges
which my disappearance may have occasioned,&rdquo;
answered her guest; &ldquo;and I assure you, once for
all, that my remaining for some time quiet at
Marchthorn, arose partly from illness, and partly
from business of a very pressing and particular
nature.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At Marchthorn!&rdquo; exclaimed Dame Dods,
&ldquo;heard ever man the like o' that!&mdash;And where
did ye put up in Marchthorn, an ane may mak'
bauld to speer?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At the Black Bull,&rdquo; replied Tyrrel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, that's auld Tam Lowrie's&mdash;a very decent
man, Thamas&mdash;and a douce creditable house&mdash;nane
of your flisk-ma-hoys&mdash;I am glad ye made
choice of sic gude quarters, neighbour; for I am
beginning to think ye are but a queer ane&mdash;ye look
as if butter wadna melt in your mouth, but I sall
warrant cheese no choke ye.&mdash;But I'll thank ye to
gang your ways into the parlour, for I am no like
to get muckle mair out o' ye, it's like; and ye are
standing here just in the gate, when we hae the
supper to dish.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_134" id="vol_ii_Page_134">[Pg&nbsp;134]</a></span></p>

<p>Tyrrel, glad to be released from the examination
to which his landlady's curiosity had without ceremony
subjected him, walked into the parlour, where
he was presently joined by Mr. Touchwood, newly
attired, and in high spirits.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here comes our supper!&rdquo; he exclaimed.&mdash;&ldquo;Sit
ye down, and let us see what Mrs. Dods has done
for us.&mdash;I profess, mistress, your plottie is excellent,
ever since I taught you to mix the spices in the
right proportion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am glad the plottie pleases ye, sir&mdash;but I
think I kend gay weel how to make it before I saw
your honour&mdash;Maister Tirl can tell that, for mony
a browst of it I hae brewed lang syne for him and
the callant Valentine Bulmer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This ill-timed observation extorted a groan from
Tyrrel; but the traveller, running on with his own
recollections, did not appear to notice his emotion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are a conceited old woman,&rdquo; said Mr.
Touchwood; &ldquo;how the devil should any one know
how to mix spices so well as he who has been where
they grow?&mdash;I have seen the sun ripening nutmegs
and cloves, and here, it can hardly fill a peasecod, by
Jupiter. Ah, Tyrrel, the merry nights we have
had at Smyrna!&mdash;Gad, I think the gammon and the
good wine taste all the better in a land where folks
hold them to be sinful indulgences&mdash;Gad, I believe
many a good Moslem is of the same opinion&mdash;that
same prohibition of their prophet's gives a flavour
to the ham, and a relish to the Cyprus.&mdash;Do you
remember old Cogia Hassein, with his green turban?&mdash;I
once played him a trick, and put a pint of
brandy into his sherbet. Egad, the old fellow took
care never to discover the cheat until he had got to
the bottom of the flagon, and then he strokes his<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_135" id="vol_ii_Page_135">[Pg&nbsp;135]</a></span>
long white beard, and says, &lsquo;Ullah Kerim,&rsquo;&mdash;that
is, &lsquo;Heaven is merciful,&rsquo; Mrs. Dods, Mr. Tyrrel
knows the meaning of it.&mdash;Ullah Kerim, says he,
after he had drunk about a gallon of brandy-punch!&mdash;Ullah
Kerim, says the hypocritical old rogue, as
if he had done the finest thing in the world!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what for no? What for shouldna the
honest man say a blessing after his drap punch?&rdquo;
demanded Mrs. Dods; &ldquo;it was better, I ween, than
blasting, and blawing, and swearing, as if folks
shouldna be thankful for the creature comforts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well said, old Dame Dods,&rdquo; replied the traveller;
&ldquo;that is a right hostess's maxim, and worthy
of Mrs. Quickly herself. Here is to thee, and I pray
ye to pledge me before ye leave the room.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Troth, I'll pledge naebody the night, Maister
Touchwood; for, what wi' the upcast and terror
that I got a wee while syne, and what wi' the bit
taste that I behoved to take of the plottie while I
was making it, my head is sair eneugh distressed
the night already.&mdash;Maister Tirl, the yellow room
is ready for ye when ye like; and, gentlemen, as
the morn is the Sabbath, I canna be keeping the
servant queans out of their beds to wait on ye ony
langer, for they will mak it an excuse for lying till
aught o'clock on the Lord's day. So, when your
plottie is done, I'll be muckle obliged to ye to
light the bedroom candles, and put out the double
moulds, and e'en show yoursells to your beds; for
douce folks, sic as the like of you, should set an
example by ordinary.&mdash;And so, gude-night to ye
baith.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By my faith,&rdquo; said Touchwood, as she withdrew,
&ldquo;our dame turns as obstinate as a Pacha
with three tails!&mdash;We have her gracious permis<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_136" id="vol_ii_Page_136">[Pg&nbsp;136]</a></span>sion
to finish our mug, however; so here is to your
health once more, Mr. Tyrrel, wishing you a hearty
welcome to your own country.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thank you, Mr. Touchwood,&rdquo; answered Tyrrel;
&ldquo;and I return you the same good wishes, with,
as I sincerely hope, a much greater chance of their
being realized.&mdash;You relieved me, sir, at a time when
the villainy of an agent, prompted, as I have reason
to think, by an active and powerful enemy, occasioned
my being, for a time, pressed for funds.&mdash;I
made remittances to the <i>Ragion</i> you dealt with, to
acquit myself at least of the pecuniary part of my
obligation; but the bills were returned, because, it
was stated, you had left Smyrna.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very true&mdash;very true&mdash;left Smyrna, and here
I am in Scotland&mdash;as for the bills, we will speak
of them another time&mdash;something due for picking
me out of the gutter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall make no deduction on that account,&rdquo;
said Tyrrel, smiling, though in no jocose mood;
&ldquo;and I beg you not to mistake me. The circumstances
of embarrassment, under which you found
me at Smyrna, were merely temporary&mdash;I am most
able and willing to pay my debt; and, let me add,
I am most desirous to do so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Another time&mdash;another time,&rdquo; said Mr. Touchwood&mdash;&ldquo;time
enough before us, Mr. Tyrrel&mdash;besides,
at Smyrna, you talked of a lawsuit&mdash;law is
a lick-penny, Mr. Tyrrel&mdash;no counsellor like the
pound in purse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For my lawsuit,&rdquo; said Tyrrel, &ldquo;I am fully
provided.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But have you good advice?&mdash;Have you good
advice?&rdquo; said Touchwood; &ldquo;answer me that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have advised with my lawyers,&rdquo; answered<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_137" id="vol_ii_Page_137">[Pg&nbsp;137]</a></span>
Tyrrel, internally vexed to find that his friend was
much disposed to make his generosity upon the
former occasion a pretext for prying farther into his
affairs now than he thought polite or convenient.</p>

<p>&ldquo;With your counsel learned in the law&mdash;eh,
my dear boy? But the advice you should take is
of some travelled friend, well acquainted with
mankind and the world&mdash;some one that has lived
double your years, and is maybe looking out for
some bare young fellow that he may do a little good
to&mdash;one that might be willing to help you farther
than I can pretend to guess&mdash;for, as to your lawyer,
you get just your guinea's worth from him&mdash;not
even so much as the baker's bargain, thirteen to the
dozen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I should not trouble myself to go far in
search of a friend such as you describe,&rdquo; said Tyrrel,
who could not affect to misunderstand the senior's
drift, &ldquo;when I was near Mr. Peregrine Touchwood;
but the truth is, my affairs are at present so much
complicated with those of others, whose secrets I
have no right to communicate, that I cannot have
the advantage of consulting you, or any other friend.
It is possible I may be soon obliged to lay aside
this reserve, and vindicate myself before the whole
public. I will not fail, when that time shall arrive,
to take an early opportunity of confidential communication
with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is right&mdash;confidential is the word&mdash;No
person ever made a confidant of me who repented
it&mdash;Think what the Pacha might have made of it,
had he taken my advice, and cut through the
Isthmus of Suez.&mdash;Turk and Christian, men of all
tongues and countries, used to consult old Touchwood,
from the building of a mosque down to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_138" id="vol_ii_Page_138">[Pg&nbsp;138]</a></span>
settling of an <i>agio</i>.&mdash;But come&mdash;Good-night&mdash;good-night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So saying, he took up his bedroom light, and
extinguished one of those which stood on the table,
nodded to Tyrrel to discharge his share of the duty
imposed by Mrs. Dods with the same punctuality,
and they withdrew to their several apartments,
entertaining very different sentiments of each other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A troublesome, inquisitive old gentleman,&rdquo; said
Tyrrel to himself; &ldquo;I remember him narrowly
escaping the bastinado at Smyrna, for thrusting his
advice on the Turkish cadi&mdash;and then I lie under
a considerable obligation to him, giving him a sort
of right to annoy me&mdash;Well, I must parry his
impertinence as I can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A shy cock this Frank Tyrrel,&rdquo; thought the
traveller; &ldquo;a very complete dodger!&mdash;But no matter&mdash;I
shall wind him, were he to double like a
fox&mdash;I am resolved to make his matters my own,
and if <i>I</i> cannot carry him through, I know not who
can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Having formed this philanthropic resolution, Mr.
Touchwood threw himself into bed, which luckily
declined exactly at the right angle, and, full of self-complacency,
consigned himself to slumber.<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_139" id="vol_ii_Page_139">[Pg&nbsp;139]</a></span></p>

<i>King Henry IV. Part I.</i><br />
</p>


<p>It had been the purpose of Tyrrel, by rising and
breakfasting early, to avoid again meeting Mr.
Touchwood, having upon his hands a matter in
which that officious gentleman's interference was
likely to prove troublesome. His character, he was
aware, had been assailed at the Spa in the most
public manner, and in the most public manner he
was resolved to demand redress, conscious that whatever
other important concerns had brought him
to Scotland, must necessarily be postponed to the
vindication of his honour. He was determined,
for this purpose, to go down to the rooms when the
company was assembled at the breakfast hour, and
had just taken his hat to set out, when he was
interrupted by Mrs. Dods, who, announcing &ldquo;a gentleman
that was speering for him,&rdquo; ushered into the
chamber a very fashionable young man in a military
surtout, covered with silk lace and fur, and wearing
a foraging-cap; a dress now too familiar to be distinguished,
but which at that time was used only by
geniuses of a superior order. The stranger was
neither handsome nor plain, but had in his appearance
a good deal of pretension, and the cool easy<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_140" id="vol_ii_Page_140">[Pg&nbsp;140]</a></span>
superiority which belongs to high breeding. On
his part, he surveyed Tyrrel; and, as his appearance
differed, perhaps, from that for which the exterior
of the Cleikum Inn had prepared him, he abated
something of the air with which he had entered the
room, and politely announced himself as Captain
Jekyl, of the &mdash;&mdash; Guards, (presenting, at the same
time, his ticket.)</p>

<p>&ldquo;He presumed he spoke to Mr. Martigny?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To Mr. Francis Tyrrel, sir,&rdquo; replied Tyrrel, drawing
himself up&mdash;&ldquo;Martigny was my mother's name&mdash;I
have never borne it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not here for the purpose of disputing that
point, Mr. Tyrrel, though I am not entitled to admit
what my principal's information leads him to doubt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your principal, I presume, is Sir Bingo Binks?&rdquo;
said Tyrrel. &ldquo;I have not forgotten that there is an
unfortunate affair between us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have not the honour to know Sir Bingo Binks,&rdquo;
said Captain Jekyl. &ldquo;I come on the part of the
Earl of Etherington.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tyrrel stood silent for a moment, and then said,
&ldquo;I am at a loss to know what the gentleman who
calls himself Earl of Etherington can have to say to
me, through the medium of such a messenger as
yourself, Captain Jekyl. I should have supposed
that, considering our unhappy relationship, and the
terms on which we stand towards each other, the
lawyers were the fitter negotiators between us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said Captain Jekyl, &ldquo;you are misunderstanding
my errand. I am come on no message of
hostile import from Lord Etherington&mdash;I am aware
of the connexion betwixt you, which would render
such an office altogether contradictory to common
sense and the laws of nature; and I assure you, I<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_141" id="vol_ii_Page_141">[Pg&nbsp;141]</a></span>
would lay down my life rather than be concerned in
an affair so unnatural. I would act, if possible, as a
mediator betwixt you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They had hitherto remained standing. Mr. Tyrrel
now offered his guest a seat; and, having assumed
one himself, he broke the awkward pause which
ensued by observing, &ldquo;I should be happy, after
experiencing such a long course of injustice and
persecution from your friend, to learn, even at this
late period, Captain Jekyl, any thing which can
make me think better, either of him, or of his purpose
towards me and towards others.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Tyrrel,&rdquo; said Captain Jekyl, &ldquo;you must
allow me to speak with candour. There is too great
a stake betwixt your brother and you to permit you
to be friends; but I do not see it is necessary that
you should therefore be mortal enemies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not my brother's enemy, Captain Jekyl,&rdquo;
said Tyrrel&mdash;&ldquo;I have never been so&mdash;His friend
I cannot be, and he knows but too well the insurmountable
barrier which his own conduct has placed
between us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am aware,&rdquo; said Captain Jekyl, slowly and
expressively, &ldquo;generally, at least, of the particulars
of your unfortunate disagreement.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If so,&rdquo; said Tyrrel, colouring, &ldquo;you must be
also aware with what extreme pain I feel myself
compelled to enter on such a subject with a total
stranger&mdash;a stranger, too, the friend and confidant
of one who&mdash;&mdash;But I will not hurt your feelings,
Captain Jekyl, but rather endeavour to suppress
my own. In one word, I beg to be favoured with
the import of your communication, as I am obliged
to go down to the Spa this morning, in order to put to
rights some matters there which concern me nearly.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_142" id="vol_ii_Page_142">[Pg&nbsp;142]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;If you mean the cause of your absence from an
appointment with Sir Bingo Binks,&rdquo; said Captain
Jekyl, &ldquo;the matter has been already completely
explained. I pulled down the offensive placard
with my own hand, and rendered myself responsible
for your honour to any one who should presume to
hold it in future doubt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said Tyrrel, very much surprised, &ldquo;I am
obliged to you for your intention, the more so as I
am ignorant how I have merited such interference.
It is not, however, quite satisfactory to me, because
I am accustomed to be the guardian of my own
honour.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;An easy task, I presume, in all cases, Mr.
Tyrrel,&rdquo; answered Jekyl, &ldquo;but peculiarly so in the
present, when you will find no one so hardy as to
assail it.&mdash;My interference, indeed, would have been
unjustifiably officious, had I not been at the moment
undertaking a commission implying confidential
intercourse with you. For the sake of my own character,
it became necessary to establish yours. I
know the truth of the whole affair from my friend,
the Earl of Etherington, who ought to thank
Heaven so long as he lives, that saved him on that
occasion from the commission of a very great
crime.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your friend, sir, has had, in the course of his
life, much to thank Heaven for, but more for which
to ask God's forgiveness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am no divine, sir,&rdquo; replied Captain Jekyl,
with spirit; &ldquo;but I have been told that the same
may be said of most men alive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I, at least, cannot dispute it,&rdquo; said Tyrrel;
&ldquo;but, to proceed.&mdash;Have you found yourself at
liberty, Captain Jekyl, to deliver to the public the<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_143" id="vol_ii_Page_143">[Pg&nbsp;143]</a></span>
whole particulars of a rencontre so singular as that
which took place between your friend and me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have not, sir,&rdquo; said Jekyl&mdash;&ldquo;I judged it a
matter of great delicacy, and which each of you had
the like interest to preserve secret.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;May I beg to know, then,&rdquo; said Tyrrel, &ldquo;how it
was possible for you to vindicate my absence from
Sir Bingo's rendezvous otherwise?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was only necessary, sir, to pledge my word
as a gentleman and a man of honour, characters in
which I am pretty well known to the world, that,
to my certain personal knowledge, you were hurt in
an affair with a friend of mine, the further particulars
of which prudence required should be sunk into
oblivion. I think no one will venture to dispute my
word, or to require more than my assurance.&mdash;If
there should be any one very hard of faith on the
occasion, I shall find a way to satisfy him. In the
meanwhile, your outlawry has been rescinded in
the most honourable manner; and Sir Bingo, in consideration
of his share in giving rise to reports so
injurious to you, is desirous to drop all further
proceedings in his original quarrel, and hopes the
whole matter will be forgot and forgiven on all
sides.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Upon my word, Captain Jekyl,&rdquo; answered
Tyrrel, &ldquo;you lay me under the necessity of acknowledging
obligation to you. You have cut a knot
which I should have found it very difficult to
unloose; for I frankly confess, that, while I was
determined not to remain under the stigma put upon
me, I should have had great difficulty in clearing
myself, without mentioning circumstances, which,
were it only for the sake of my father's memory,
should be buried in eternal oblivion. I hope your<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_144" id="vol_ii_Page_144">[Pg&nbsp;144]</a></span>
friend feels no continued inconvenience from his
hurt?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;His lordship is nearly quite recovered,&rdquo; said
Jekyl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I trust he did me the justice to own, that,
so far as my will was concerned, I am totally guiltless
of the purpose of hurting him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He does you full justice in that and every
thing else,&rdquo; replied Jekyl; &ldquo;regrets the impetuosity
of his own temper, and is determined to be on his
guard against it in future.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; said Tyrrel, &ldquo;is so far well; and now,
may I ask once more, what communication you have
to make to me on the part of your friend?&mdash;Were
it from any one but him, whom I have found so
uniformly false and treacherous, your own fairness
and candour would induce me to hope that this
unnatural quarrel might be in some sort ended by
your mediation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I then proceed, sir, under more favourable
auspices than I expected,&rdquo; said Captain Jekyl, &ldquo;to
enter on my commission.&mdash;You are about to commence
a lawsuit, Mr. Tyrrel, if fame does not wrong
you, for the purpose of depriving your brother of
his estate and title.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The case is not fairly stated, Captain Jekyl,&rdquo;
replied Tyrrel; &ldquo;I commence a lawsuit, when I
do commence it, for the sake of ascertaining my
own just rights.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It comes to the same thing eventually,&rdquo; said
the mediator; &ldquo;I am not called upon to decide
upon the justice of your claims, but they are, you
will allow, newly started. The late Countess of
Etherington died in possession&mdash;open and undoubted
possession&mdash;of her rank in society.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_145" id="vol_ii_Page_145">[Pg&nbsp;145]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;If she had no real claim to it, sir,&rdquo; replied
Tyrrel, &ldquo;she had more than justice who enjoyed it
so long; and the injured lady whose claims were
postponed, had just so much less.&mdash;But this is no
point for you and me to discuss between us&mdash;it
must be tried elsewhere.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Proofs, sir, of the strongest kind, will be necessary
to overthrow a right so well established in
public opinion as that of the present possessor of
the title of Etherington.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tyrrel took a paper from his pocketbook, and,
handing it to Captain Jekyl, only answered, &ldquo;I have
no thoughts of asking you to give up the cause of
your friend; but methinks the documents of which
I give you a list, may shake your opinion of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Captain Jekyl read, muttering to himself, &ldquo;&lsquo;<i>Certificate
of marriage, by the Rev. Zadock Kemp, chaplain
to the British Embassy at Paris, between Marie
de Bellroche, Comptesse de Martigny, and the Right
Honourable John Lord Oakendale&mdash;Letters between
John Earl of Etherington and his lady, under the
title of Madame de Martigny&mdash;Certificate of baptism&mdash;Declaration
of the Earl of Etherington on
his death-bed.</i>&rsquo;&mdash;All this is very well&mdash;but may I
ask you, Mr. Tyrrel, if it is really your purpose to
go to extremity with your brother?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He has forgot that he is one&mdash;he has lifted his
hand against my life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have shed his blood&mdash;twice shed it,&rdquo; said
Jekyl; &ldquo;the world will not ask which brother gave
the offence, but which received, which inflicted, the
severest wound.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your friend has inflicted one on me, sir,&rdquo; said
Tyrrel, &ldquo;that will bleed while I have the power of
memory.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_146" id="vol_ii_Page_146">[Pg&nbsp;146]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I understand you, sir,&rdquo; said Captain Jekyl;
&ldquo;you mean the affair of Miss Mowbray?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Spare me on that subject, sir!&rdquo; said Tyrrel.
&ldquo;Hitherto I have disputed my most important
rights&mdash;rights which involved my rank in society,
my fortune, the honour of my mother&mdash;with something
like composure; but do not say more on the
topic you have touched upon, unless you would
have before you a madman!&mdash;Is it possible for you,
sir, to have heard even the outline of this story,
and to imagine that I can ever reflect on the cold-blooded
and most inhuman stratagem, which this
friend of yours prepared for two unfortunates, without&rdquo;&mdash;He
started up, and walked impetuously
to and fro. &ldquo;Since the Fiend himself interrupted
the happiness of perfect innocence, there was never
such an act of treachery&mdash;never such schemes of
happiness destroyed&mdash;never such inevitable misery
prepared for two wretches who had the idiocy to
repose perfect confidence in him!&mdash;Had there been
passion in his conduct, it had been the act of a man&mdash;a
wicked man, indeed, but still a human creature,
acting under the influence of human feelings&mdash;but
his was the deed of a calm, cold, calculating demon,
actuated by the basest and most sordid motives of
self-interest, joined, as I firmly believe, to an early
and inveterate hatred of one whose claims he considered
as at variance with his own.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sorry to see you in such a temper,&rdquo; said
Captain Jekyl, calmly; &ldquo;Lord Etherington, I trust,
acted on very different motives than those you
impute to him; and if you will but listen to me,
perhaps something may be struck out which may
accommodate these unhappy disputes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said Tyrrel, sitting down again, &ldquo;I will<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_147" id="vol_ii_Page_147">[Pg&nbsp;147]</a></span>
listen to you with calmness, as I would remain
calm under the probe of a surgeon tenting a festered
wound. But when you touch me to the
quick, when you prick the very nerve, you cannot
expect me to endure without wincing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will endeavour, then, to be as brief in the
operation as I can,&rdquo; replied Captain Jekyl, who
possessed the advantage of the most admirable
composure during the whole conference. &ldquo;I conclude,
Mr. Tyrrel, that the peace, happiness, and
honour of Miss Mowbray, are dear to you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who dare impeach her honour!&rdquo; said Tyrrel,
fiercely; then checking himself, added, in a more
moderate tone, but one of deep feeling, &ldquo;they are
dear to me, sir, as my eyesight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My friend holds them in equal regard,&rdquo; said
the Captain; &ldquo;and has come to the resolution of
doing her the most ample justice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He can do her justice no otherwise, than by
ceasing to haunt this neighbourhood, to think, to
speak, even to dream of her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lord Etherington thinks otherwise,&rdquo; said Captain
Jekyl; &ldquo;he believes that if Miss Mowbray
has sustained any wrong at his hands, which, of
course, I am not called upon to admit, it will be
best repaired by the offer to share with her his
title, his rank, and his fortune.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;His title, rank, and fortune, sir, are as much a
falsehood as he is himself,&rdquo; said Tyrrel, with violence&mdash;&ldquo;Marry
Clara Mowbray? never!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My friend's fortune, you will observe,&rdquo; replied
Jekyl, &ldquo;does not rest entirely upon the event of
the lawsuit with which you, Mr. Tyrrel, now
threaten him.&mdash;Deprive him, if you can, of the
Oakendale estate, he has still a large patrimony by<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_148" id="vol_ii_Page_148">[Pg&nbsp;148]</a></span>
his mother; and besides, as to his marriage with
Clara Mowbray, he conceives, that unless it should
be the lady's wish to have the ceremony repeated
to which he is most desirous to defer his own opinion,
they have only to declare that it has already
passed between them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A trick, sir!&rdquo; said Tyrrel, &ldquo;a vile infamous trick!
of which the lowest wretch in Newgate would be
ashamed&mdash;the imposition of one person for another.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of that, Mr. Tyrrel, I have seen no evidence
whatever. The clergyman's certificate is clear&mdash;Francis
Tyrrel is united to Clara Mowbray in the
holy bands of wedlock&mdash;such is the tenor&mdash;there
is a copy&mdash;nay, stop one instant, if you please, sir.
You say there was an imposition in the case&mdash;I
have no doubt but you speak what you believe, and
what Miss Mowbray told you. She was surprised&mdash;forced
in some measure from the husband she
had just married&mdash;ashamed to meet her former
lover, to whom, doubtless, she had made many a
vow of love, and ne'er a true one&mdash;what wonder
that, unsupported by her bridegroom, she should
have changed her tone, and thrown all the blame
of her own inconstancy on the absent swain?&mdash;A
woman, at a pinch so critical, will make the most
improbable excuse, rather than be found guilty on
her own confession.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There must be no jesting in this case,&rdquo; said
Tyrrel, his cheek becoming pale, and his voice
altered with passion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am quite serious, sir,&rdquo; replied Jekyl; &ldquo;and
there is no law court in Britain that would take
the lady's word&mdash;all she has to offer, and that in
her own cause&mdash;against a whole body of evidence
direct and circumstantial, showing that she was by<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_149" id="vol_ii_Page_149">[Pg&nbsp;149]</a></span>
her own free consent married to the gentleman who
now claims her hand.&mdash;Forgive me, sir&mdash;I see you
are much agitated&mdash;I do not mean to dispute your
right of believing what you think is most credible&mdash;I
only use the freedom of pointing out to you
the impression which the evidence is likely to make
on the minds of indifferent persons.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your friend,&rdquo; answered Tyrrel, affecting a composure,
which, however, he was far from possessing,
&ldquo;may think by such arguments to screen his
villainy; but it cannot avail him&mdash;the truth is
known to Heaven&mdash;it is known to me&mdash;and there
is, besides, one indifferent witness upon earth, who
can testify that the most abominable imposition
was practised on Miss Mowbray.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean her cousin,&mdash;Hannah Irwin, I think,
is her name,&rdquo; answered Jekyl; &ldquo;you see I am fully
acquainted with all the circumstances of the case.
But where is Hannah Irwin to be found?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She will appear, doubtless, in Heaven's good
time, and to the confusion of him who now imagines
the only witness of his treachery&mdash;the only one
who could tell the truth of this complicated
mystery&mdash;either no longer lives, or, at least, cannot
be brought forward against him, to the ruin of his
schemes. Yes, sir, that slight observation of yours
has more than explained to me why your friend, or,
to call him by his true name, Mr. Valentine Bulmer,
has not commenced his machinations sooner, and
also why he has commenced them now. He thinks
himself certain that Hannah Irwin is not now in
Britain, or to be produced in a court of justice&mdash;he
may find himself mistaken.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My friend seems perfectly confident of the issue
of his cause,&rdquo; answered Jekyl; &ldquo;but for the lady's<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_150" id="vol_ii_Page_150">[Pg&nbsp;150]</a></span>
sake, he is most unwilling to prosecute a suit which
must be attended with so many circumstances of
painful exposure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Exposure, indeed!&rdquo; answered Tyrrel; &ldquo;thanks
to the traitor who laid a mine so fearful, and who
now affects to be reluctant to fire it.&mdash;Oh! how I
am bound to curse that affinity that restrains my
hands! I would be content to be the meanest and
vilest of society, for one hour of vengeance on this
unexampled hypocrite!&mdash;One thing is certain, sir&mdash;your
friend will have no living victim. His persecution
will kill Clara Mowbray, and fill up the
cup of his crimes, with the murder of one of the
sweetest&mdash;&mdash;I shall grow a woman, if I say more
on the subject!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My friend,&rdquo; said Jekyl, &ldquo;since you like best
to have him so defined, is as desirous as you can be
to spare the lady's feelings; and with that view,
not reverting to former passages, he has laid before
her brother a proposal of alliance, with which Mr.
Mowbray is highly pleased.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; said Tyrrel, starting&mdash;&ldquo;And the
lady?&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the lady so far proved favourable, as
to consent that Lord Etherington shall visit
Shaws-Castle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Her consent must have been extorted!&rdquo;
exclaimed Tyrrel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was given voluntarily,&rdquo; said Jekyl, &ldquo;as I
am led to understand; unless, perhaps, in so far as
the desire to veil these very unpleasing transactions
may have operated, I think naturally enough, to
induce her to sink them in eternal secrecy, by
accepting Lord Etherington's hand.&mdash;I see, sir, I
give you pain, and am sorry for it.&mdash;I have no title<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_151" id="vol_ii_Page_151">[Pg&nbsp;151]</a></span>
to call upon you for any exertion of generosity;
but, should such be Miss Mowbray's sentiments, is
it too much to expect of you, that you will not
compromise the lady's honour by insisting upon
former claims, and opening up disreputable transactions
so long past?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Captain Jekyl,&rdquo; said Tyrrel, solemnly, &ldquo;I have
no claims. Whatever I might have had, were cancelled
by the act of treachery through which your
friend endeavoured too successfully to supplant me.
Were Clara Mowbray as free from her pretended
marriage as law could pronounce her, still with me&mdash;<i>me</i>,
at least, of all men in the world&mdash;the
obstacle must ever remain, that the nuptial benediction
has been pronounced over her, and the man
whom I must for once call <i>brother</i>.&rdquo;&mdash;He stopped at
that word, as if it had cost him agony to pronounce
it, and then resumed:&mdash;&ldquo;No, sir, I have no views
of personal advantage in this matter&mdash;they have
been long annihilated&mdash;But I will not permit Clara
Mowbray to become the wife of a villain&mdash;I will
watch over her with thoughts as spotless as those
of her guardian angel. I first persuaded her
to quit the path of duty<a name="vol_ii_FNanchor_B_14" id="vol_ii_FNanchor_B_14"></a><a href="#vol_ii_Footnote_B_14" class="fnanchor">[B]</a>&mdash;I, of all men who
live, am bound to protect her from the misery&mdash;from
the guilt&mdash;which must attach to her as this
man's wife. I will never believe that she wishes it&mdash;I
will never believe, that in calm mind and sober
reason, she can be brought to listen to such a guilty
proposal.&mdash;But her mind&mdash;alas!&mdash;is not of the
firm texture it once could boast; and your friend
knows well how to press on the spring of every
passion that can agitate and alarm her. Threats of
exposure may extort her consent to this most unfit<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_152" id="vol_ii_Page_152">[Pg&nbsp;152]</a></span>ting
match, if they do not indeed drive her to
suicide, which I think the most likely termination.
I will, therefore, be strong where she is weak.&mdash;Your
friend, sir, must at least strip his proposals of
their fine gilding. I will satisfy Mr. Mowbray of
St. Ronan's of his false pretences, both to rank and
fortune; and I rather think he will protect his sister
against the claim of a needy profligate, though
he might be dazzled with the alliance of a wealthy
peer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your cause, sir, is not yet won,&rdquo; answered
Jekyl; &ldquo;and when it is, your brother will retain
property enough to entitle him to marry a greater
match than Miss Mowbray, besides the large estate
of Nettlewood, to which that alliance must give
him right. But I would wish to make some accommodation
between you if it were possible. You
profess, Mr. Tyrrel, to lay aside all selfish wishes
and views in this matter, and to look entirely to
Miss Mowbray's safety and happiness?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Such, upon my honour, is the exclusive purpose
of my interference&mdash;I would give all I am worth
to procure her an hour of quiet&mdash;for happiness she
will never know again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your anticipations of Miss Mowbray's distress,&rdquo;
said Jekyl, &ldquo;are, I understand, founded upon the
character of my friend. You think him a man of
light principle, and because he overreached you in
a juvenile intrigue, you conclude that now, in his
more steady and advanced years, the happiness of
the lady in whom you are so much interested ought
not to be trusted to him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There may be other grounds,&rdquo; said Tyrrel, hastily;
&ldquo;but you may argue upon those you have
named, as sufficient to warrant my interference.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_153" id="vol_ii_Page_153">[Pg&nbsp;153]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;How, then, if I should propose some accommodation
of this nature? Lord Etherington does
not pretend to the ardour of a passionate lover.
He lives much in the world, and has no desire to
quit it. Miss Mowbray's health is delicate&mdash;her
spirits variable&mdash;and retirement would most probably
be her choice.&mdash;Suppose&mdash;I am barely putting
a supposition&mdash;suppose that a marriage between
two persons so circumstanced were rendered necessary
or advantageous to both&mdash;suppose that such
a marriage were to secure to one party a large
estate&mdash;were to insure the other against all the
consequences of an unpleasant exposure&mdash;still, both
ends might be obtained by the mere ceremony of
marriage passing between them. There might be
a previous contract of separation, with suitable provisions
for the lady, and stipulations, by which the
husband should renounce all claim to her society.
Such things happen every season, if not on the
very marriage day, yet before the honeymoon is
over.&mdash;Wealth and freedom would be the lady's,
and as much rank as you, sir, supposing your claims
just, may think proper to leave them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a long pause, during which Tyrrel
underwent many changes of countenance, which
Jekyl watched carefully, without pressing him for
an answer. At length he replied, &ldquo;There is much
in your proposal, Captain Jekyl, which I might be
tempted to accede to, as one manner of unloosing
this Gordian knot, and a compromise by which Miss
Mowbray's future tranquillity would be in some
degree provided for. But I would rather trust a
fanged adder than your friend, unless I saw him
fettered by the strongest ties of interest. Besides,
I am certain the unhappy lady could never survive<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_154" id="vol_ii_Page_154">[Pg&nbsp;154]</a></span>
the being connected with him in this manner,
though but for the single moment when they should
appear together at the altar. There are other
objections&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>He checked himself, paused, and then proceeded
in a calm and self-possessed tone. &ldquo;You think,
perhaps, even yet, that I have some selfish and
interested views in this business; and probably you
may feel yourself entitled to entertain the same
suspicion towards me, which I avowedly harbour
respecting every proposition which originates with
your friend.&mdash;I cannot help it&mdash;I can but meet
these disadvantageous impressions with plain dealing
and honesty; and it is in the spirit of both
that <i>I</i> make a proposition to <i>you</i>.&mdash;Your friend is
attached to rank, fortune, and worldly advantages, in
the usual proportion, at least, in which they are pursued
by men of the world&mdash;this you must admit,
and I will not offend you by supposing more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know few people who do not desire such
advantages,&rdquo; answered Captain Jekyl; &ldquo;and I
frankly own, that he affects no particular degree of
philosophic indifference respecting them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be it so,&rdquo; answered Tyrrel. &ldquo;Indeed, the proposal
you have just made indicates that his pretended
claim on this young lady's hand is entirely, or almost
entirely, dictated by motives of interest, since you
are of opinion that he would be contented to separate
from her society on the very marriage day,
provided that, in doing so, he was assured of the
Nettlewood property.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My proposition was unauthorized by my principal,&rdquo;
answered Jekyl; &ldquo;but it is needless to deny,
that its very tenor implies an idea, on my part, that
Lord Etherington is no passionate lover.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_155" id="vol_ii_Page_155">[Pg&nbsp;155]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well then,&rdquo; answered Tyrrel. &ldquo;Consider, sir,
and let him consider well, that the estate and rank
he now assumes, depend upon my will and pleasure&mdash;that,
if I prosecute the claims of which that scroll
makes you aware, he must descend from the rank
of an earl into that of a commoner, stripped of by
much the better half of his fortune&mdash;a diminution
which would be far from compensated by the estate
of Nettlewood, even if he could obtain it, which
could only be by means of a lawsuit, precarious
in the issue, and most dishonourable in its very
essence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, sir,&rdquo; replied Jekyl, &ldquo;I perceive your
argument&mdash;What is your proposal?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That I will abstain from prosecuting my claim
on those honours and that property&mdash;that I will
leave Valentine Bulmer in possession of his usurped
title and ill-deserved wealth&mdash;that I will bind
myself under the strongest penalties never to disturb
his possession of the Earldom of Etherington
and estates belonging to it&mdash;on condition that he
allows the woman, whose peace of mind he has
ruined for ever, to walk through the world in her
wretchedness, undisturbed either by his marriage-suit,
or by any claim founded upon his own most
treacherous conduct&mdash;in short, that he forbear to
molest Clara Mowbray, either by his presence, word,
letter, or through the intervention of a third party,
and be to her in future as if he did not exist.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is a singular offer,&rdquo; said the Captain; &ldquo;may
I ask if you are serious in making it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am neither surprised nor offended at the question,&rdquo;
said Tyrrel. &ldquo;I am a man, sir, like others,
and affect no superiority to that which all men
desire the possession of&mdash;a certain consideration<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_156" id="vol_ii_Page_156">[Pg&nbsp;156]</a></span>
and station in society. I am no romantic fool to
undervalue the sacrifice I am about to make. I
renounce a rank, which is and ought to be the more
valuable to me, because it involves (he blushed as he
spoke) the fame of an honoured mother&mdash;because,
in failing to claim it, I disobey the commands of a
dying father, who wished that by doing so I should
declare to the world the penitence which hurried
him perhaps to the grave, and the making which
public he considered might be some atonement for
his errors. From an honoured place in the land, I
descend voluntarily to become a nameless exile;
for, once certain that Clara Mowbray's peace is
assured, Britain no longer holds me.&mdash;All this I
do, sir, not in any idle strain of overheated feeling,
but seeing, and knowing, and dearly valuing, every
advantage which I renounce&mdash;yet I do it, and do
it willingly, rather than be the cause of farther evil
to one, on whom I have already brought too&mdash;too
much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His voice, in spite of his exertions, faltered as he
concluded the sentence, and a big drop which rose
to his eye, required him for the moment to turn
towards the window.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am ashamed of this childishness,&rdquo; he said,
turning again to Captain Jekyl; &ldquo;if it excites your
ridicule, sir, let it be at least a proof of my
sincerity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am far from entertaining such sentiments,&rdquo;
said Jekyl, respectfully&mdash;for, in a long train of
fashionable follies, his heart had not been utterly
hardened&mdash;&ldquo;very far, indeed. To a proposal so
singular as yours, I cannot be expected to answer&mdash;except
thus far&mdash;the character of the peerage is,
I believe, indelible, and cannot be resigned or<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_157" id="vol_ii_Page_157">[Pg&nbsp;157]</a></span>
assumed at pleasure. If you are really Earl of
Etherington, I cannot see how your resigning the
right may avail my friend.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You, sir, it might not avail,&rdquo; said Tyrrel,
gravely, &ldquo;because you, perhaps, might scorn to exercise
a right, or hold a title, that was not legally
yours. But your friend will have no such compunctious
visitings. If he can act the Earl to the
eye of the world, he has already shown that his
honour and conscience will be easily satisfied.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;May I take a copy of the memorandum containing
this list of documents,&rdquo; said Captain Jekyl, &ldquo;for
the information of my constituent?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The paper is at your pleasure, sir,&rdquo; replied
Tyrrel; &ldquo;it is itself but a copy.&mdash;But Captain
Jekyl,&rdquo; he added, with a sarcastic expression, &ldquo;is,
it would seem, but imperfectly let into his friend's
confidence&mdash;he may be assured his principal is completely
acquainted with the contents of this paper,
and has accurate copies of the deeds to which it
refers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think it scarce possible,&rdquo; said Jekyl, angrily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Possible and certain!&rdquo; answered Tyrrel. &ldquo;My
father, shortly preceding his death, sent me&mdash;with
a most affecting confession of his errors&mdash;this list
of papers, and acquainted me that he had made a
similar communication to your friend. That he did
so I have no doubt, however Mr. Bulmer may have
thought proper to disguise the circumstance in communication
with you. One circumstance, among
others, stamps at once his character, and confirms
me of the danger he apprehended by my return to
Britain. He found means, through a scoundrelly
agent, who had made me the usual remittances
from my father while alive, to withhold those which<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_158" id="vol_ii_Page_158">[Pg&nbsp;158]</a></span>
were necessary for my return from the Levant, and
I was obliged to borrow from a friend.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed?&rdquo; replied Jekyl. &ldquo;It is the first time
I have heard of these papers&mdash;May I enquire where
the originals are, and in whose custody?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was in the East,&rdquo; answered Tyrrel, &ldquo;during
my father's last illness, and these papers were by
him deposited with a respectable commercial house,
with which he was connected. They were enclosed
in a cover directed to me, and that again in an
envelope, addressed to the principal person in their
firm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must be sensible,&rdquo; said Captain Jekyl,
&ldquo;that I can scarcely decide on the extraordinary
offer which you have been pleased to make, of
resigning the claim founded on these documents,
unless I had a previous opportunity of examining
them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You shall have that opportunity&mdash;I will write
to have them sent down by the post&mdash;they lie but
in small compass.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This, then,&rdquo; said the Captain, &ldquo;sums up all that
can be said at present.&mdash;Supposing these proofs
to be of unexceptionable authenticity, I certainly
would advise my friend Etherington to put to sleep
a claim so important as yours, even at the expense
of resigning his matrimonial speculation&mdash;I presume
you design to abide by your offer?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not in the habit of altering my mind&mdash;still
less of retracting my word,&rdquo; said Tyrrel, somewhat
haughtily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We part friends, I hope?&rdquo; said Jekyl, rising,
and taking his leave.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not enemies certainly, Captain Jekyl. I will
own to you I owe you my thanks, for extricating<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_159" id="vol_ii_Page_159">[Pg&nbsp;159]</a></span>
me from that foolish affair at the Well&mdash;nothing
could have put me to more inconvenience than the
necessity of following to extremity a frivolous
quarrel at the present moment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will come down among us, then?&rdquo; said
Jekyl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I certainly shall not wish to appear to hide
myself,&rdquo; answered Tyrrel; &ldquo;it is a circumstance
might be turned against me&mdash;there is a party who
will avail himself of every advantage. I have but
one path, Captain Jekyl&mdash;that of truth and honour.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Captain Jekyl bowed, and took his leave. So
soon as he was gone, Tyrrel locked the door of the
apartment, and drawing from his bosom a portrait,
gazed on it with a mixture of sorrow and tenderness,
until the tears dropped from his eye.</p>

<p>It was the picture of Clara Mowbray, such as he
had known her in the days of their youthful love,
and taken by himself, whose early turn for painting
had already developed itself. The features of the
blooming girl might be yet traced in the fine countenance
of the more matured original. But what was
now become of the glow which had shaded her
cheek?&mdash;what of the arch, yet subdued pleasantry,
which lurked in the eye?&mdash;what of the joyous
content, which composed every feature to the expression
of an Euphrosyne?&mdash;Alas! these were long
fled!&mdash;Sorrow had laid his hand upon her&mdash;the
purple light of youth was quenched&mdash;the glance of
innocent gaiety was exchanged for looks now moody
with ill-concealed care, now animated by a spirit of
reckless and satirical observation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a wreck! what a wreck!&rdquo; exclaimed
Tyrrel; &ldquo;and all of one wretch's making.&mdash;Can I
put the last hand to the work, and be her murderer<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_160" id="vol_ii_Page_160">[Pg&nbsp;160]</a></span>
outright? I cannot&mdash;I cannot!&mdash;I will be strong
in the resolve I have formed&mdash;I will sacrifice all&mdash;rank&mdash;station&mdash;fortune&mdash;and
fame. Revenge!&mdash;Revenge
itself, the last good left me&mdash;revenge
itself I will sacrifice, to obtain for her such tranquillity
as she may be yet capable to enjoy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In this resolution he sat down, and wrote a letter
to the commercial house with whom the documents
of his birth, and other relative papers, were deposited,
requesting that the packet containing them
should be forwarded to him through the post-office.</p>

<p>Tyrrel was neither unambitious, nor without those
sentiments respecting personal consideration, which
are usually united with deep feeling and an ardent
mind. It was with a trembling hand, and a watery
eye, but with a heart firmly resolved, that he sealed
and dispatched the letter; a step towards the
resignation, in favour of his mortal enemy, of that
rank and condition in life, which was his own by
right of inheritance, but had so long hung in doubt
betwixt them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_161" id="vol_ii_Page_161">[Pg&nbsp;161]</a></span></p>

<i>Measure for Measure.</i><br />
</p>


<p>It was now far advanced in autumn. The dew
lay thick on the long grass, where it was touched
by the sun; but where the sward lay in shadow, it
was covered with hoar frost, and crisped under
Jekyl's foot, as he returned through the woods of St.
Ronan's. The leaves of the ash-trees detached
themselves from the branches, and, without an air
of wind, fell spontaneously on the path. The mists
still lay lazily upon the heights, and the huge old
tower of St. Ronan's was entirely shrouded with
vapour, except where a sunbeam, struggling with
the mist, penetrated into its wreath so far as to
show a projecting turret upon one of the angles of
the old fortress, which, long a favourite haunt of the
raven, was popularly called the Corbie's Tower.
Beneath, the scene was open and lightsome, and the
robin redbreast was chirping his best, to atone for
the absence of all other choristers. The fine foliage
of autumn was seen in many a glade, running up
the sides of each little ravine, russet-hued and golden-specked,
and tinged frequently with the red hues
of the mountain-ash; while here and there a huge<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_162" id="vol_ii_Page_162">[Pg&nbsp;162]</a></span>
old fir, the native growth of the soil, flung his broad
shadow over the rest of the trees, and seemed to
exult in the permanence of his dusky livery over
the more showy, but transitory brilliance by which
he was surrounded.</p>

<p>Such is the scene, which, so often described in
prose and in poetry, yet seldom loses its effect upon
the ear or upon the eye, and through which we
wander with a strain of mind congenial to the
decline of the year. There are few who do not feel
the impression; and even Jekyl, though bred to far
different pursuits than those most favourable to
such contemplation, relaxed his pace to admire the
uncommon beauty of the landscape.</p>

<p>Perhaps, also, he was in no hurry to rejoin the
Earl of Etherington, towards whose service he felt
himself more disinclined since his interview with
Tyrrel. It was clear that that nobleman had not
fully reposed in his friend the confidence promised;
he had not made him aware of the existence of those
important documents of proof, on which the whole
fate of his negotiation appeared now to hinge, and
in so far had deceived him. Yet, when he pulled
from his pocket, and re-read Lord Etherington's
explanatory letter, Jekyl could not help being more
sensible than he had been on the first perusal, how
much the present possessor of that title felt alarmed
at his brother's claims; and he had some compassion
for the natural feeling that must have rendered
him shy of communicating at once the very worst
view of his case, even to his most confidential friend.
Upon the whole, he remembered that Lord Etherington
had been his benefactor to an unusual extent;
that, in return, he had promised the young nobleman
his active and devoted assistance, in extricating<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_163" id="vol_ii_Page_163">[Pg&nbsp;163]</a></span>
him from the difficulties with which he seemed
at present surrounded; that, in quality of his confidant,
he had become acquainted with the most
secret transactions of his life; and that it could
only be some very strong cause indeed which could
justify breaking off from him at this moment.
Yet he could not help wishing either that his
own obligations had been less, his friend's cause
better, or, at least, the friend himself more worthy
of assistance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A beautiful morning, sir, for such a foggy, d&mdash;&mdash;d
climate as this,&rdquo; said a voice close by Jekyl's ear,
which made him at once start out of his contemplation.
He turned half round, and beside him
stood our honest friend Touchwood, his throat
muffled in his large Indian handkerchief, huge
gouty shoes thrust upon his feet, his bobwig well
powdered, and the gold-headed cane in his hand,
carried upright as a sergeant's halberd. One glance
of contemptuous survey entitled Jekyl, according
to his modish ideas, to rank the old gentleman as
a regular-built quiz, and to treat him as the young
gentlemen of his Majesty's Guards think themselves
entitled to use every unfashionable variety of the
human species. A slight inclination of a bow, and
a very cold &ldquo;You have the advantage of me, sir,&rdquo;
dropped as it were unconsciously from his tongue,
were meant to repress the old gentleman's advances,
and moderate his ambition to be hail fellow well met
with his betters. But Mr. Touchwood was callous
to the intended rebuke; he had lived too much at
large upon the world, and was far too confident of
his own merits, to take a repulse easily, or to permit
his modesty to interfere with any purpose which
he had formed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_164" id="vol_ii_Page_164">[Pg&nbsp;164]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Advantage of you, sir?&rdquo; he replied; &ldquo;I have
lived too long in the world not to keep all the
advantages I have, and get all I can&mdash;and I reckon
it one that I have overtaken you, and shall have the
pleasure of your company to the Well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should but interrupt your worthier meditations,
sir,&rdquo; said the other; &ldquo;besides, I am a modest
young man, and think myself fit for no better
company than my own&mdash;moreover, I walk slow&mdash;very
slow.&mdash;Good morning to you, Mr. A&mdash;A&mdash;I
believe my treacherous memory has let slip your
name, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My name!&mdash;Why your memory must have
been like Pat Murtough's greyhound, that let the
hare go before he caught it. You never heard my
name in your life. Touchwood is my name. What
d'ye think of it, now you know it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am really no connoisseur in surnames,&rdquo;
answered Jekyl: &ldquo;and it is quite the same to me
whether you call yourself Touchwood or Touchstone.
Don't let me keep you from walking on,
sir. You will find breakfast far advanced at the
Well, sir, and your walk has probably given you an
appetite.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Which will serve me to luncheon-time, I promise
you,&rdquo; said Touchwood; &ldquo;I always drink my
coffee as soon as my feet are in my pabouches&mdash;it's
the way all over the East. Never trust my breakfast
to their scalding milk-and-water at the Well,
I assure you; and for walking slow, I have had a
touch of the gout.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you,&rdquo; said Jekyl; &ldquo;I am sorry for that;
because, if you have no mind to breakfast, I have&mdash;and
so, Mr. Touchstone, good-morrow to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But, although the young soldier went off at double<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_165" id="vol_ii_Page_165">[Pg&nbsp;165]</a></span>
quick time, his pertinacious attendant kept close by
his side, displaying an activity which seemed inconsistent
with his make and his years, and talking
away the whole time, so as to show that his lungs
were not in the least degree incommoded by the
unusual rapidity of motion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, young gentleman, if you are for a good
smart walk, I am for you, and the gout may be
d&mdash;d. You are a lucky fellow to have youth on
your side; but yet, so far as between the Aultoun
and the Well, I think I could walk you for your
sum, barring running&mdash;all heel and toe&mdash;equal
weight, and I would match Barclay himself for a
mile.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Upon my word, you are a gay old gentleman!&rdquo;
said Jekyl, relaxing his pace; &ldquo;and if we must
be fellow-travellers, though I can see no great
occasion for it, I must even shorten sail for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So saying, and as if another means of deliverance
had occurred to him, he slackened his pace, took
out a morocco case of cigars, and, lighting one
with his <i>briquet</i>, said, while he walked on, and
bestowed as much of its fragrance as he could
upon the face of his intrusive companion, &ldquo;Vergeben
sie, mein herr&mdash;ich bin erzogen in kaiserlicher
dienst&mdash;muss rauchen ein kleine wenig.&rdquo;<a name="vol_ii_FNanchor_6_6" id="vol_ii_FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#vol_ii_Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>&ldquo;Rauchen sie immer fort,&rdquo; said Touchwood,
producing a huge meerschaum, which, suspended
by a chain from his neck, lurked in the bosom of
his coat, &ldquo;habe auch mein pfeichen&mdash;Sehen sie
den lieben topf!&rdquo;<a name="vol_ii_FNanchor_7_7" id="vol_ii_FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#vol_ii_Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> and he began to return the<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_166" id="vol_ii_Page_166">[Pg&nbsp;166]</a></span>
smoke, if not the fire, of his companion, in full
volumes, and with interest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The devil take the twaddle,&rdquo; said Jekyl to
himself, &ldquo;he is too old and too fat to be treated
after the manner of Professor Jackson; and, on
my life, I cannot tell what to make of him.&mdash;He
is a residenter too&mdash;I must tip him the cold
shoulder, or he will be pestering me eternally.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Accordingly, he walked on, sucking his cigar,
and apparently in as abstracted a mood as Mr.
Cargill himself, without paying the least attention
to Touchwood, who, nevertheless, continued talking,
as if he had been addressing the most attentive
listener in Scotland, whether it were the favourite
nephew of a cross, old, rich bachelor, or the aid-de-camp
of some old rusty firelock of a general, who
tells stories of the American war.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And so, sir, I can put up with any companion at
a pinch, for I have travelled in all sorts of ways,
from a caravan down to a carrier's cart; but the
best society is the best every where; and I am
happy I have fallen in with a gentleman who suits
me so well as you.&mdash;That grave, steady attention
of yours reminds me of Elfi Bey&mdash;you might talk
to him in English, or any thing he understood least
of&mdash;you might have read Aristotle to Elfi, and not
a muscle would he stir&mdash;give him his pipe, and he
would sit on his cushion with a listening air as if
he took in every word of what you said.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Captain Jekyl threw away the remnant of his
cigar, with a little movement of pettishness, and
began to whistle an opera air.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There again, now!&mdash;That is just so like the
Marquis of Roccombole, another dear friend of
mine, that whistles all the time you talk to him<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_167" id="vol_ii_Page_167">[Pg&nbsp;167]</a></span>&mdash;He
says he learned it in the Reign of Terror, when
a man was glad to whistle to show his throat was
whole. And, talking of great folk, what do you
think of this affair between Lord Etherington and
his brother, or cousin, as some folk call him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jekyl absolutely started at the question; a degree
of emotion, which, had it been witnessed by any of
his fashionable friends, would for ever have ruined
his pretensions to rank in the first order.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What affair?&rdquo; he asked, so soon as he could
command a certain degree of composure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, you know the news surely? Francis
Tyrrel, whom all the company voted a coward the
other day, turns out as brave a fellow as any of us;
for, instead of having run away to avoid having his
own throat cut by Sir Bingo Binks, he was at the
very moment engaged in a gallant attempt to murder
his elder brother, or his more lawful brother, or
his cousin, or some such near relation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe you are misinformed, sir,&rdquo; said Jekyl
dryly, and then resumed, as deftly as he could, his
proper character of a pococurante.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am told,&rdquo; continued Touchwood, &ldquo;one Jekyl
acted as a second to them both on the occasion&mdash;a
proper fellow, sir&mdash;one of those fine gentlemen
whom we pay for polishing the pavement in Bond
Street, and looking at a thick shoe and a pair of
worsted stockings, as if the wearer were none of
their paymasters. However, I believe the Commander-in-Chief
is like to discard him when he
hears what has happened.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir!&rdquo; said Jekyl, fiercely&mdash;then, recollecting
the folly of being angry with an original of his
companion's description, he proceeded more coolly,
&ldquo;You are misinformed&mdash;Captain Jekyl knew noth<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_168" id="vol_ii_Page_168">[Pg&nbsp;168]</a></span>ing
of any such matter as you refer to&mdash;you talk
of a person you know nothing of&mdash;Captain Jekyl
is&mdash;&mdash;(Here he stopped a little, scandalized, perhaps,
at the very idea of vindicating himself to such
a personage from such a charge.)</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay,&rdquo; said the traveller, filling up the chasm
in his own way, &ldquo;he is not worth our talking of,
certainly&mdash;but I believe he knew as much of the
matter as either you or I do, for all that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir, this is either a very great mistake, or wilful
impertinence,&rdquo; answered the officer. &ldquo;However
absurd or intrusive you may be, I cannot allow you,
either in ignorance or incivility, to use the name
of Captain Jekyl with disrespect.&mdash;I am Captain
Jekyl, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very like, very like,&rdquo; said Touchwood, with the
most provoking indifference; &ldquo;I guessed as much
before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then, sir, you may guess what is likely to follow,
when a gentleman hears himself unwarrantably
and unjustly slandered,&rdquo; replied Captain Jekyl, surprised
and provoked that his annunciation of name
and rank seemed to be treated so lightly. &ldquo;I advise
you, sir, not to proceed too far upon the immunities
of your age and insignificance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never presume farther than I have good reason
to think necessary, Captain Jekyl,&rdquo; answered
Touchwood, with great composure. &ldquo;I am too
old, as you say, for any such idiotical business as
a duel, which no nation I know of practises but our
silly fools of Europe&mdash;and then, as for your switch,
which you are grasping with so much dignity, that
is totally out of the question. Look you, young
gentleman; four-fifths of my life have been spent
among men who do not set a man's life at the value<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_169" id="vol_ii_Page_169">[Pg&nbsp;169]</a></span>
of a button on his collar&mdash;every person learns, in
such cases, to protect himself as he can; and whoever
strikes me must stand to the consequences. I
have always a brace of bull-dogs about me, which
put age and youth on a level. So suppose me
horsewhipped, and pray, at the same time, suppose
yourself shot through the body. The same exertion
of imagination will serve for both purposes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So saying, he exhibited a very handsome, highly
finished, and richly-mounted pair of pistols.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Catch me without my tools,&rdquo; said he, significantly
buttoning his coat over the arms, which
were concealed in a side-pocket, ingeniously contrived
for that purpose. &ldquo;I see you do not know
what to make of me,&rdquo; he continued, in a familiar
and confidential tone; &ldquo;but, to tell you the truth,
everybody that has meddled in this St. Ronan's
business is a little off the hooks&mdash;something of
a <i>t&ecirc;te exalt&eacute;e</i>, in plain words, a little crazy, or so;
and I do not affect to be much wiser than other
people.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said Jekyl, &ldquo;your manners and discourse
are so unprecedented, that I must ask your meaning
plainly and decidedly&mdash;Do you mean to insult
me or no?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No insult at all, young gentleman&mdash;all fair
meaning, and above board&mdash;I only wished to let
you know what the world may say, that is all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said Jekyl, hastily, &ldquo;the world may tell
what lies it pleases; but I was not present at the
rencontre between Etherington and Mr. Tyrrel&mdash;I
was some hundred miles off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There now,&rdquo; said Touchwood, &ldquo;there <i>was</i> a rencontre
between them&mdash;the very thing I wanted to
know.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_170" id="vol_ii_Page_170">[Pg&nbsp;170]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said Jekyl, aware too late that, in his
haste to vindicate himself, he had committed his
friend, &ldquo;I desire you will found nothing on an
expression hastily used to vindicate myself from
a false aspersion&mdash;I only meant to say, if there
was an affair such as you talk of, I knew nothing
of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind&mdash;never mind&mdash;I shall make no
bad use of what I have learned,&rdquo; said Touchwood.
&ldquo;Were you to eat your words with the best fish-sauce,
(and that is Burgess's,) I have got all the
information from them I wanted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are strangely pertinacious, sir,&rdquo; replied
Jekyl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, a rock, a piece of flint for that&mdash;What I
have learned, I have learned, but I will make no
bad use of it.&mdash;Hark ye, Captain, I have no malice
against your friend&mdash;perhaps the contrary&mdash;but he
is in a bad course, sir&mdash;has kept a false reckoning,
for as deep as he thinks himself; and I tell you so,
because I hold you (your finery out of the question)
to be, as Hamlet says, indifferent honest; but, if
you were not, why necessity is necessity; and a
man will take a Bedouin for his guide in the desert,
whom he would not trust with an aspar in the
cultivated field; so I think of reposing some confidence
in you&mdash;have not made up my mind yet,
though.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;On my word, sir, I am greatly flattered both
by your intentions and your hesitation,&rdquo; said Captain
Jekyl. &ldquo;You were pleased to say just now,
that every one concerned with these matters was
something particular.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay&mdash;something crazy&mdash;a little mad, or so.
That was what I said, and I can prove it.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_171" id="vol_ii_Page_171">[Pg&nbsp;171]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I should be glad to hear the proof,&rdquo; said Jekyl&mdash;&ldquo;I
hope you do not except yourself?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! by no means,&rdquo; answered Touchwood; &ldquo;I
am one of the maddest old boys ever slept out of
straw, or went loose. But you can put fishing
questions in your turn, Captain, I see that&mdash;you
would fain know how much, or how little, I am in
all these secrets. Well, that is as hereafter may be.
In the meantime, here are my proofs.&mdash;Old Scrogie
Mowbray was mad, to like the sound of Mowbray
better than that of Scrogie; young Scrogie was
mad, not to like it as well. The old Earl of Etherington
was not sane when he married a French
wife in secret, and devilish mad indeed when he
married an English one in public. Then for the
good folk here, Mowbray of St. Ronan's is cracked,
when he wishes to give his sister to he knows not precisely
whom: She is a fool not to take him, because
she <i>does</i> know who he is, and what has been
between them; and your friend is maddest of all,
who seeks her under so heavy a penalty:&mdash;and
you and I, Captain, go mad gratis, for company's
sake, when we mix ourselves with such a mess of
folly and frenzy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really, sir, all that you have said is an absolute
riddle to me,&rdquo; replied the embarrassed Jekyl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Riddles may be read,&rdquo; said Touchwood, nodding;
&ldquo;if you have any desire to read mine, pray,
take notice, that this being our first interview, I
have exerted myself <i>faire les frais du conversation</i>,
as Jack Frenchman says; if you want another, you
may come to Mrs. Dods's at the Cleikum Inn, any
day before Saturday, at four precisely, when you
will find none of your half-starved, long-limbed
bundles of bones, which you call poultry at the<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_172" id="vol_ii_Page_172">[Pg&nbsp;172]</a></span>
table-d'h&ocirc;te, but a right Chitty-gong fowl!&mdash;I got
Mrs. Dods the breed from old Ben Vandewash, the
Dutch broker&mdash;stewed to a minute, with rice and
mushrooms.&mdash;If you can eat without a silver fork,
and your appetite serves you, you shall be welcome&mdash;that's
all.&mdash;So, good morning to you, good master
lieutenant, for a captain of the Guards is but a
lieutenant after all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So saying, and ere Jekyl could make any answer,
the old gentleman turned short off into a path
which led to the healing fountain, branching away
from that which conducted to the Hotel.</p>

<p>Uncertain with whom he had been holding a
conversation so strange, Jekyl remained looking
after him, until his attention was roused by a little
boy, who crept out from an adjoining thicket, with
a switch in his hand, which he had been just cutting,&mdash;probably
against regulations to the contrary
effect made and provided, for he held himself ready
to take cover in the copse again, in case any one
were in sight who might be interested in chastising
his delinquency. Captain Jekyl easily recognised
in him one of that hopeful class of imps, who pick
up a precarious livelihood about places of public
resort, by going errands, brushing shoes, doing the
groom's and coachman's work in the stables, driving
donkeys, opening gates, and so forth, for about one-tenth
part of their time, spending the rest in
gambling, sleeping in the sun, and otherwise qualifying
themselves to exercise the profession of thieves
and pickpockets, either separately, or in conjunction
with those of waiters, grooms, and postilions. The
little outcast had an indifferent pair of pantaloons,
and about half a jacket, for, like Pentapolin with
the naked arm, he went on action with his right<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_173" id="vol_ii_Page_173">[Pg&nbsp;173]</a></span>
shoulder bare; a third part of what had once been
a hat covered his hair, bleached white with the sun,
and his face, as brown as a berry, was illuminated
by a pair of eyes, which, for spying out either peril
or profit, might have rivalled those of the hawk.&mdash;In
a word, it was the original Puck of the Shaws
dramaticals.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come hither, ye unhanged whelp,&rdquo; said Jekyl,
&ldquo;and tell me if you know the old gentleman that
passed down the walk just now&mdash;yonder he is, still
in sight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is the Naboab,&rdquo; said the boy; &ldquo;I could swear
to his back among all the backs at the Waal, your
honour.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you call a Nabob, you varlet?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A Naboab&mdash;a Naboab?&rdquo; answered the scout;
&ldquo;odd, I believe it is ane comes frae foreign parts,
with mair siller than his pouches can haud, and
spills it a' through the country&mdash;they are as yellow
as orangers, and maun hae a' thing their ain gate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what is this Naboab's name, as you call
him?&rdquo; demanded Jekyl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;His name is Touchwood,&rdquo; said his informer;
&ldquo;ye may see him at the Waal every morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have not seen him at the ordinary.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Na, na,&rdquo; answered the boy; &ldquo;he is a queer
auld cull, he disna frequent wi' other folk, but lives
upby at the Cleikum.&mdash;He gave me half-a-crown
yince, and forbade me to play it awa' at pitch and
toss.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you disobeyed him, of course?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Na, I didna dis-obeyed him&mdash;I played it awa'

<p>So saying he gave the little galopin his donative,
and a slight rap on the pate at the same time,
which sent him scouring from his presence. He
himself hastened to Lord Etherington's apartments,
and, as luck would have it, found the Earl alone.<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_175" id="vol_ii_Page_175">[Pg&nbsp;175]</a></span></p>

<i>Richard III.</i><br />
</p>


<p>&ldquo;How now, Jekyl!&rdquo; said Lord Etherington, eagerly;
&ldquo;what news from the enemy?&mdash;Have you seen
him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have,&rdquo; replied Jekyl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And in what humour did you find him?&mdash;in
none that was very favourable, I dare say, for you
have a baffled and perplexed look, that confesses a
losing game&mdash;I have often warned you how your
hang-dog look betrays you at brag&mdash;And then,
when you would fain brush up your courage, and
put a good face on a bad game, your bold looks
always remind me of a standard hoisted only half-mast
high, and betraying melancholy and dejection,
instead of triumph and defiance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am only holding the cards for your lordship
at present,&rdquo; answered Jekyl; &ldquo;and I wish to
Heaven there may be no one looking over the hand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you mean by that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, I was beset, on returning through the
wood, by an old bore, a Nabob, as they call him,
and Touchwood by name.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have seen such a quiz about,&rdquo; said Lord
Etherington&mdash;&ldquo;What of him?&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_176" id="vol_ii_Page_176">[Pg&nbsp;176]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; answered Jekyl, &ldquo;except that he
seemed to know much more of your affairs than you
would wish or are aware of. He smoked the truth
of the rencontre betwixt Tyrrel and you, and what
is worse&mdash;I must needs confess the truth&mdash;he contrived
to wring out of me a sort of confirmation of
his suspicions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;'Slife! wert thou mad?&rdquo; said Lord Etherington,
turning pale; &ldquo;His is the very tongue to send the
story through the whole country&mdash;Hal, you have
undone me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope not,&rdquo; said Jekyl; &ldquo;I trust in Heaven I
have not!&mdash;His knowledge is quite general&mdash;only
that there was some scuffle between you&mdash;Do not
look so dismayed about it, or I will e'en go back
and cut his throat, to secure his secrecy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cursed indiscretion!&rdquo; answered the Earl&mdash;&ldquo;how
could you let him fix on you at all?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot tell,&rdquo; said Jekyl&mdash;&ldquo;he has powers of
boring beyond ten of the dullest of all possible doctors&mdash;stuck
like a limpet to a rock&mdash;a perfect double
of the Old Man of the Sea, who I take to have been
the greatest bore on record.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Could you not have turned him on his back
like a turtle, and left him there?&rdquo; said Lord
Etherington.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And had an ounce of lead in my body for my
pains? No&mdash;no&mdash;we have already had footpad
work enough&mdash;I promise you the old buck was
armed, as if he meant to bing folks on the low
toby.&rdquo;<a name="vol_ii_FNanchor_8_8" id="vol_ii_FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#vol_ii_Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;well&mdash;But Martigny, or Tyrrel, as you
call him&mdash;what says he?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Tyrrel, or Martigny, as your lordship<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_177" id="vol_ii_Page_177">[Pg&nbsp;177]</a></span>
calls him,&rdquo; answered Jekyl, &ldquo;will by no means
listen to your lordship's proposition. He will not
consent that Miss Mowbray's happiness shall be
placed in your lordship's keeping; nay, it did not
meet his approbation a bit the more, when I hinted
at the acknowledgment of the marriage, or the
repetition of the ceremony, attended by an immediate
separation, which I thought I might venture
to propose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And on what grounds does he refuse so reasonable
an accommodation?&rdquo; said Lord Etherington&mdash;&ldquo;Does
he still seek to marry the girl himself?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe he thinks the circumstances of the
case render that impossible,&rdquo; replied his confidant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What? then he would play the dog in the
manger&mdash;neither eat nor let eat?&mdash;He shall find
himself mistaken. She has used me like a dog,
Jekyl, since I saw you; and, by Jove! I will have
her, that I may break her pride, and cut him to the
liver with the agony of seeing it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, but hold&mdash;hold!&rdquo; said Jekyl; &ldquo;perhaps
I have something to say on his part, that may be
a better compromise than all you could have by
teasing him. He is willing to purchase what he
calls Miss Mowbray's tranquillity, at the expense
of his resignation of his claims to your father's
honours and estate; and he surprised me very much,
my lord, by showing me this list of documents,
which, I am afraid, makes his success more than
probable, if there really are such proofs in existence.&rdquo;
Lord Etherington took the paper, and seemed
to read with much attention, while Jekyl proceeded,&mdash;&ldquo;He
has written to procure these evidences from
the person with whom they are deposited.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We shall see what like they are when they<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_178" id="vol_ii_Page_178">[Pg&nbsp;178]</a></span>
arrive,&rdquo; said Lord Etherington.&mdash;&ldquo;They come by
post, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; and may be immediately expected,&rdquo; answered
Jekyl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;he is my brother on one side of the
house, at least,&rdquo; said Lord Etherington; &ldquo;and I
should not much like to have him lagged for forgery,
which I suppose will be the end of his
bolstering up an unsubstantial plea by fabricated
documents&mdash;I should like to see these same papers
he talks of.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, my lord,&rdquo; replied Jekyl, &ldquo;Tyrrel's allegation
is, that you <i>have</i> seen them; and that copies,
at least, were made out for you, and are in your
possession&mdash;such is his averment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He lies,&rdquo; answered Lord Etherington, &ldquo;so far as
he pretends I know of such papers. I consider the
whole story as froth&mdash;foam&mdash;fudge, or whatever
is most unsubstantial. It will prove such when the
papers appear, if indeed they ever will appear. The
whole is a bully from beginning to end; and I wonder
at thee, Jekyl, for being so thirsty after syllabub,
that you can swallow such whipt cream as that
stuff amounts to. No, no&mdash;I know my advantage,
and shall use it so as to make all their hearts
bleed. As for these papers, I recollect now that my
agent talked of copies of some manuscripts having
been sent him, but the originals were not then forthcoming;
and I'll bet the long odds that they never
are&mdash;mere fabrications&mdash;if I thought otherwise,
would I not tell you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly, I hope you would, my lord,&rdquo; said
Jekyl; &ldquo;for I see no chance of my being useful
to you, unless I have the honour to enjoy your
confidence.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_179" id="vol_ii_Page_179">[Pg&nbsp;179]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You do&mdash;you do, my friend,&rdquo; said Etherington,
shaking him by the hand; &ldquo;and since I must consider
your present negotiation as failed, I must devise
some other mode of settling with this mad and
troublesome fellow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No violence, my lord,&rdquo; said Jekyl, once more,
and with much emphasis.</p>

<p>&ldquo;None&mdash;none&mdash;none, by Heaven!&mdash;Why, thou
suspicious wretch, must I swear, to quell your
scruples?&mdash;On the contrary, it shall not be my
fault, if we are not on decent terms.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would be infinitely to the advantage of both
your characters if you could bring that to pass,&rdquo;
answered Jekyl; &ldquo;and if you are serious in wishing
it, I will endeavour to prepare Tyrrel. He comes
to the Well or to the ordinary to-day, and it would
be highly ridiculous to make a scene.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;True, true; find him out, my dear Jekyl, and
persuade him how foolish it will be to bring our
family quarrels out before strangers, and for their
amusement. They shall see the two bears can meet
without biting.&mdash;Go&mdash;go&mdash;I will follow you
instantly&mdash;go, and remember you have my full
and exclusive confidence.&mdash;Go, half-bred, startling
fool!&rdquo; he continued, the instant Jekyl had left the
room, &ldquo;with just spirits enough to ensure your own
ruin, by hurrying you into what you are not up to.&mdash;But
he has character in the world&mdash;is brave&mdash;and
one of those whose countenance gives a fair face to
a doubtful business. He is my creature, too&mdash;I
have bought and paid for him, and it would be idle
extravagance not to make use of him&mdash;But as to
confidence&mdash;no confidence, honest Hal, beyond that
which cannot be avoided. If I wanted a confidant,
here comes a better than thou by half&mdash;Solmes has<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_180" id="vol_ii_Page_180">[Pg&nbsp;180]</a></span>
no scruples&mdash;he will always give me money's worth
of zeal and secrecy <i>for</i> money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His lordship's valet at this moment entered the
apartment, a grave, civil-looking man, past the
middle age, with a sallow complexion, a dark
thoughtful eye, slow, and sparing of speech, and
sedulously attentive to all the duties of his situation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Solmes,&rdquo;&mdash;said Lord Etherington, and then
stopped short.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My lord&rdquo;&mdash;There was a pause; and when Lord
Etherington had again said, &ldquo;Solmes!&rdquo; and his
valet had answered, &ldquo;Your lordship,&rdquo; there was a
second pause; until the Earl, as if recollecting himself,
&ldquo;Oh! I remember what I wished to say&mdash;it
was about the course of post here. It is not very
regular, I believe?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Regular enough, my lord, so far as concerns
this place&mdash;the people in the Aultoun do not get
their letters in course.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And why not, Solmes?&rdquo; said his lordship.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The old woman who keeps the little inn there,
my lord, is on bad terms with the post-mistress&mdash;the
one will not send for the letters, and the other
will not dispatch them to the village; so, betwixt
them, they are sometimes lost or mislaid, or returned
to the General Post-office.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish that may not be the case of a packet
which I expect in a few days&mdash;it should have been
here already, or, perhaps, it may arrive in the beginning
of the week&mdash;it is from that formal ass,
Trueman the Quaker, who addresses me by my
Christian and family name, Francis Tyrrel. He is
like enough to mistake the inn, too, and I should
be sorry it fell into Monsieur Martigny's hands&mdash;I
suppose you know he is in that neighbourhood?<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_181" id="vol_ii_Page_181">[Pg&nbsp;181]</a></span>&mdash;Look
after its safety, Solmes&mdash;quietly, you understand;
because people might put odd constructions,
as if I were wanting a letter which was not my
own.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I understand perfectly, my lord,&rdquo; said Solmes,
without exhibiting the slightest change in his sallow
countenance, though entirely comprehending
the nature of the service required.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And here is a note will pay for postage,&rdquo; said
the Earl, putting into his valet's hand a bank-bill
of considerable value; &ldquo;and you may keep the
balance for occasional expenses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was also fully understood; and Solmes, too
politic and cautious even to look intelligence, or
acknowledge gratitude, made only a bow of acquiescence,
put the note into his pocketbook, and
assured his lordship that his commands should be
punctually attended to.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There goes the agent for my money, and for
my purpose,&rdquo; said Lord Etherington, exultingly;
&ldquo;no extorting of confidence, no demanding of explanations,
no tearing off the veil with which a delicate
man&oelig;uvre is <i>gaz&eacute;</i>&mdash;all excuses are received as
<i>argent comptant</i>, provided only, that the best excuse
of all, the <i>argent comptant</i> itself, come to recommend
them.&mdash;Yet I will trust no one&mdash;I will
out, like a skilful general, and reconnoitre in
person.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With this resolution, Lord Etherington put on
his surtout and cap, and sallying from his apartments,
took the way to the bookseller's shop, which
also served as post-office and circulating library;
and being in the very centre of the parade, (for so
is termed the broad terrace walk which leads from
the inn to the Well,) it formed a convenient loung<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_182" id="vol_ii_Page_182">[Pg&nbsp;182]</a></span>ing-place
for newsmongers and idlers of every
description.</p>

<p>The Earl's appearance created, as usual, a sensation
upon the public promenade; but whether it
was the suggestion of his own alarmed conscience,
or that there was some real cause for the remark,
he could not help thinking his reception was of a
more doubtful character than usual. His fine figure
and easy manners produced their usual effect, and
all whom he spoke to received his attention as an
honour; but none offered, as usual, to unite themselves
to him, or to induce him to join their party.
He seemed to be looked on rather as an object of
observation and attention, than as making one of
the company; and to escape from a distant gaze,
which became rather embarrassing, he turned into
the little emporium of news and literature.</p>

<p>He entered unobserved, just as Lady Penelope
had finished reading some verses, and was commenting
upon them with all the alacrity of a <i>femme
savante</i>, in possession of something which no one is
to hear repeated oftener than once.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Copy&mdash;no indeed!&rdquo; these were the snatches
which reached Lord Etherington's ear, from the
group of which her ladyship formed the centre&mdash;&ldquo;honour
bright&mdash;I must not betray poor Chatterly&mdash;besides,
his lordship is my friend, and a person
of rank, you know&mdash;so one would not&mdash;You have
not got the book, Mr. Pott?&mdash;you have not got
Statius?&mdash;you never have any thing one longs to
see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very sorry, my lady&mdash;quite out of copies at
present&mdash;I expect some in my next monthly
parcel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good lack, Mr. Pott, that is your never-failing<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_183" id="vol_ii_Page_183">[Pg&nbsp;183]</a></span>
answer,&rdquo; said Lady Penelope; &ldquo;I believe if I
were to ask you for the last new edition of the
Alkoran, you would tell me it was coming down
in your next monthly parcel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can't say, my lady, really,&rdquo; answered Mr. Pott;
&ldquo;have not seen the work advertised yet; but I
have no doubt, if it is likely to take, there will be
copies in my next monthly parcel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Pott's supplies are always in the <i>paullo
post futurum</i> tense,&rdquo; said Mr. Chatterly, who was
just entering the shop.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! Mr. Chatterly, are you there?&rdquo; said Lady
Penelope; &ldquo;I lay my death at your door&mdash;I cannot
find this Thebaid, where Polynices and his
brother&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush, my lady!&mdash;hush, for Heaven's sake!&rdquo;
said the poetical divine, and looked towards Lord
Etherington. Lady Penelope took the hint, and
was silent; but she had said enough to call up the
traveller Touchwood, who raised his head from the
newspaper which he was studying, and, without
addressing his discourse to any one in particular,
ejaculated, as if in scorn of Lady Penelope's
geography&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Polynices?&mdash;Polly Peachum.&mdash;There is no
such place in the Thebais&mdash;the Thebais is in Egypt&mdash;the
mummies come from the Thebais&mdash;I have
been in the catacombs&mdash;caves very curious indeed&mdash;we
were lapidated by the natives&mdash;pebbled to
some purpose, I give you my word. My janizary
thrashed a whole village by way of retaliation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>While he was thus proceeding, Lord Etherington,
as if in a listless mood, was looking at the letters
which stood ranged on the chimney-piece, and
carrying on a languid dialogue with Mrs. Pott,<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_184" id="vol_ii_Page_184">[Pg&nbsp;184]</a></span>
whose person and manners were not ill adapted to
her situation, for she was good-looking, and vastly
fine and affected.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Number of letters here which don't seem to find
owners, Mrs. Pott?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Great number, indeed, my lord&mdash;it is a great
vexation, for we are obliged to return them to the
post-office, and the postage is charged against us if
they are lost; and how can one keep sight of them
all?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Any love-letters among them, Mrs. Pott?&rdquo; said
his lordship, lowering his tone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, fie! my lord, how should I know?&rdquo;
answered Mrs. Pott, dropping her voice to the same
cadence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! every one can tell a love-letter&mdash;that has
ever received one, that is&mdash;one knows them without
opening&mdash;they are always folded hurriedly and
sealed carefully&mdash;and the direction manifests a
kind of tremulous agitation, that marks the state of
the writer's nerves&mdash;that now,&rdquo;&mdash;pointing with
his switch to a letter upon the chimney-piece,
&ldquo;that <i>must</i> be a love-letter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He, he, he!&rdquo; giggled Mrs. Pott, &ldquo;I beg pardon
for laughing, my lord&mdash;but&mdash;he, he, he!&mdash;that is
a letter from one Bindloose, the banker body, to the
old woman Luckie Dods, as they call her, at the
change-house in the Aultoun.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Depend upon it then, Mrs. Pott, that your
neighbour, Mrs. Dods, has got a lover in Mr.
Bindloose&mdash;unless the banker has been shaking
hands with the palsy. Why do you not forward
her letter?&mdash;you are very cruel to keep it in
durance here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Me forward!&rdquo; answered Mrs. Pott; &ldquo;the cap<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_185" id="vol_ii_Page_185">[Pg&nbsp;185]</a></span>pernoity,
old, girning alewife, may wait long enough
or I forward it&mdash;She'll not loose the letters that
come to her by the King's post, and she must go on
troking wi' the old carrier, as if there was no post-house
in the neighbourhood. But the solicitor will
be about wi' her one of these days.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! you are too cruel&mdash;you really should send
the love-letter; consider, the older she is, the poor
soul has the less time to lose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But this was a topic on which Mrs. Pott understood
no jesting. She was well aware of our
matron's inveteracy against her and her establishment,
and she resented it as a placeman resents
the efforts of a radical. She answered something
sulkily, &ldquo;That they that loosed letters should have
letters; and neither Luckie Dods, nor any of her
lodgers, should ever see the scrape of a pen from
the St. Ronan's office, that they did not call for and
pay for.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is probable that this declaration contained the
essence of the information which Lord Etherington
had designed to extract by his momentary flirtation
with Mrs. Pott; for when, retreating as it were from
this sore subject, she asked him, in a pretty mincing
tone, to try his skill in pointing out another love-letter,
he only answered carelessly, &ldquo;that in order
to do that he must write her one;&rdquo; and leaving his
confidential station by her little throne, he lounged
through the narrow shop, bowed slightly to Lady
Penelope as he passed, and issued forth upon the
parade, where he saw a spectacle which might well
have appalled a man of less self-possession than
himself.</p>

<p>Just as he left the shop, little Miss Digges
entered almost breathless, with the emotion of<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_186" id="vol_ii_Page_186">[Pg&nbsp;186]</a></span>
impatience and of curiosity. &ldquo;Oh la! my lady,
what do you stay here for?&mdash;Mr. Tyrrel has just
entered the other end of the parade this moment,
and Lord Etherington is walking that way&mdash;they
must meet each other.&mdash;O lord! come, come away,
and see them meet!&mdash;I wonder if they'll speak&mdash;I
hope they won't fight&mdash;Oh la! do come, my lady!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must go with you, I find,&rdquo; said Lady Penelope;
&ldquo;it is the strangest thing, my love, that
curiosity of yours about other folk's matters&mdash;I
wonder what your mamma will say to it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! never mind mamma&mdash;nobody minds her&mdash;papa,
nor nobody&mdash;Do come, dearest Lady Pen,
or I will run away by myself.&mdash;Mr. Chatterly, do
make her come!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must come, it seems,&rdquo; said Lady Penelope,
&ldquo;or I shall have a pretty account of you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But, notwithstanding this rebuke, and forgetting,
at the same time, that people of quality ought never
to seem in a hurry, Lady Penelope, with such of
her satellites as she could hastily collect around her,
tripped along the parade with unusual haste, in
sympathy, doubtless, with Miss Digges's curiosity, as
her ladyship declared she had none of her own.</p>

<p>Our friend, the traveller, had also caught up Miss
Digges's information; and, breaking off abruptly an
account of the Great Pyramid, which had been naturally
introduced by the mention of the Thebais, and
echoing the fair alarmist's words, &ldquo;hope they won't
fight,&rdquo; he rushed upon the parade, and bustled along
as hard as his sturdy supporters could carry him. If
the gravity of the traveller, and the delicacy of
Lady Penelope, were surprised into unwonted haste
from their eagerness to witness the meeting of
Tyrrel and Lord Etherington, it may be well sup<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_187" id="vol_ii_Page_187">[Pg&nbsp;187]</a></span>posed
that the decorum of the rest of the company
was a slender restraint on their curiosity, and that
they hurried to be present at the expected scene,
with the alacrity of gentlemen of the fancy hastening
to a set-to.</p>

<p>In truth, though the meeting afforded little sport
to those who expected dire conclusions, it was,
nevertheless, sufficiently interesting to those spectators
who are accustomed to read the language of
suppressed passion betraying itself at the moment
when the parties are most desirous to conceal it.</p>

<p>Tyrrel had been followed by several loiterers so
soon as he entered the public walk; and their number
was now so much reinforced, that he saw
himself with pain and displeasure the centre of a
sort of crowd who watched his motions. Sir Bingo
and Captain MacTurk were the first to bustle through
it, and to address him with as much politeness as
they could command.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Servant, sir,&rdquo; mumbled Sir Bingo, extending
the right hand of fellowship and reconciliation,
ungloved. &ldquo;Servant&mdash;sorry that anything should
have happened between us&mdash;very sorry, on my
word.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No more need be said, sir,&rdquo; replied Tyrrel; &ldquo;the
whole is forgotten.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very handsome, indeed&mdash;quite the civil thing&mdash;hope
to meet you often, sir.&rdquo;&mdash;And here the
knight was silent.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the more verbose Captain proceeded,
&ldquo;Och, py Cot, and it was an awfu' mistake, and I
could draw the penknife across my finger for having
written the word.&mdash;By my sowl, and I scratched it
till I scratched a hole in the paper.&mdash;Och! that I
should live to do an uncivil thing by a gentleman<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_188" id="vol_ii_Page_188">[Pg&nbsp;188]</a></span>
that had got himself hit in an honourable affair!
But you should have written, my dear; for how the
devil could we guess that you were so well provided
in quarrels, that you had to settle two in one day!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was hurt in an unexpected&mdash;an accidental
manner, Captain MacTurk. I did not write,
because there was something, in my circumstances
at the moment which required secrecy; but I was
resolved, the instant I recovered, to put myself to
rights in your good opinion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Och! and you have done that,&rdquo; said the Captain,
nodding sagaciously; &ldquo;for Captain Jekyl, who
is a fine child, has put us all up to your honourable
conduct. They are pretty boys, these guardsmen,
though they may play a little fine sometimes, and
think more of themselves than peradventure they
need for to do, in comparison with us of the line.&mdash;But
he let us know all about it&mdash;and, though
he said not a word of a certain fine lord, with his
footpad, and his hurt, and what not, yet we all
knew how to lay that and that together.&mdash;And
if the law would not right you, and there were bad
words between you, why should not two gentlemen
right themselves? And as to your being kinsmen,
why should not kinsmen behave to each other like
men of honour? Only, some say you are father's
sons, and that <i>is</i> something too near.&mdash;I had once
thoughts of calling out my uncle Dougal myself,
for there is no saying where the line should be
drawn; but I thought, on the whole, there should
be no fighting, as there is no marriage, within the
forbidden degrees. As for first cousins&mdash;Wheugh!&mdash;that's
all fair&mdash;fire away, Flanigan!&mdash;But
here is my lord, just upon us, like a stag of the first
head, and the whole herd behind him.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_189" id="vol_ii_Page_189">[Pg&nbsp;189]</a></span></p>

<p>Tyrrel stepped forward a little before his officious
companions, his complexion rapidly changing into
various shades, like that of one who forces himself
to approach and touch some animal or reptile
for which he entertains that deep disgust and
abhorrence which was anciently ascribed to constitutional
antipathy. This appearance of constraint
put upon himself, with the changes which it produced
on his face, was calculated to prejudice him
somewhat in the opinion of the spectators, when
compared with the steady, stately, yet, at the same
time, easy demeanour of the Earl of Etherington,
who was equal to any man in England in the difficult
art of putting a good countenance on a bad
cause. He met Tyrrel with an air as unembarrassed,
as it was cold; and, while he paid the courtesy
of a formal and distant salutation, he said aloud,
&ldquo;I presume, Mr. Tyrrel de Martigny, that, since
you have not thought fit to avoid this awkward
meeting, you are disposed to remember our family
connexion so far as to avoid making sport for the
good company?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have nothing to apprehend from my passion,
Mr. Bulmer,&rdquo; replied Tyrrel, &ldquo;if you can assure
yourself against the consequences of your own.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am glad of that,&rdquo; said the Earl, with the
same composure, but sinking his voice so as only
to be heard by Tyrrel; &ldquo;and as we may not again
in a hurry hold any communication together, I take
the freedom to remind you, that I sent you a proposal
of accommodation by my friend, Mr. Jekyl.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was inadmissible,&rdquo; said Tyrrel&mdash;&ldquo;altogether
inadmissible&mdash;both from reasons which you may
guess, and others which it is needless to detail.&mdash;I
sent you a proposition, think of it well.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_190" id="vol_ii_Page_190">[Pg&nbsp;190]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; replied Lord Etherington, &ldquo;when I
shall see it supported by those alleged proofs, which
I do not believe ever had existence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your conscience holds another language from
your tongue,&rdquo; said Tyrrel; &ldquo;but I disclaim
reproaches, and decline altercation. I will let Captain
Jekyl know when I have received the papers,
which, you say, are essential to your forming an
opinion on my proposal.&mdash;In the meanwhile, do
not think to deceive me. I am here for the very
purpose of watching and defeating your machinations;
and, while I live, be assured they shall never
succeed.&mdash;And now, sir&mdash;or my lord&mdash;for the
titles are in your choice&mdash;fare you well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold a little,&rdquo; said Lord Etherington. &ldquo;Since
we are condemned to shock each other's eyes, it
is fit the good company should know what they
are to think of us. You are a philosopher, and do
not value the opinion of the public&mdash;a poor worldling
like me is desirous to stand fair with it.&mdash;Gentlemen,&rdquo;
he continued, raising his voice, &ldquo;Mr.
Winterblossom, Captain MacTurk, Mr.&mdash;what is his
name, Jekyl?&mdash;Ay, Micklehen&mdash;You have, I
believe, all some notion, that this gentleman, my
near relation, and I, have some undecided claims on
each other, which prevent our living upon good terms.
We do not mean, however, to disturb you with our
family quarrels; and, for my own part, while this
gentleman, Mr. Tyrrel, or whatever he may please
to call himself, remains a member of this company,
my behaviour to him will be the same as to any
stranger who may have that advantage.&mdash;Good
morrow to you, sir&mdash;Good morning, gentlemen&mdash;we
all meet at dinner, as usual.&mdash;Come, Jekyl.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So saying, he took Jekyl by the arm, and, gently<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_191" id="vol_ii_Page_191">[Pg&nbsp;191]</a></span>
extricating himself from the sort of crowd, walked
off, leaving most of the company prepossessed in
his favour, by the ease and apparent reasonableness
of his demeanour. Sounds of depreciation, forming
themselves indistinctly into something like the
words, &ldquo;my eye, and Betty Martin,&rdquo; did issue
from the neckcloth of Sir Bingo, but they were not
much attended to; for it had not escaped the observation
of the quicksighted gentry at the Well, that
the Baronet's feelings towards the noble Earl were
in the inverse ratio of those displayed by Lady
Binks, and that, though ashamed to testify, or perhaps
incapable of feeling, any anxious degree of
jealousy, his temper had been for some time considerably
upon the fret; a circumstance concerning
which his fair moiety did not think it necessary to
give herself any concern.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Earl of Etherington walked
onward with his confidant, in the full triumph of
successful genius.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;Jekyl, that I can turn a
corner with any man in England. It was a proper
blunder of yours, that you must extricate the fellow
from the mist which accident had flung around him&mdash;you
might as well have published the story of
our rencontre at once, for every one can guess it, by
laying time, place, and circumstance together; but
never trouble your brains for a justification. You
marked how I assumed my natural superiority over
him&mdash;towered up in the full pride of legitimacy&mdash;silenced
him even where the good company most do
congregate. This will go to Mowbray through his
agent, and will put him still madder on my alliance.
I know he looks jealously on my flirtation with a
certain lady&mdash;the dasher yonder&mdash;nothing makes<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_192" id="vol_ii_Page_192">[Pg&nbsp;192]</a></span>
a man sensible of the value of an opportunity, but
the chance of losing it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish to Heaven you would give up thoughts
of Miss Mowbray!&rdquo; said Jekyl; &ldquo;and take Tyrrel's
offer, if he has the means of making it good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, if&mdash;if. But I am quite sure he has no
such rights as he pretends to, and that his papers
are all a deception.&mdash;Why do you put your eye
upon me as fixed as if you were searching out some
wonderful secret?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish I knew what to think of your real <i>bona
fide</i> belief respecting these documents,&rdquo; said Jekyl,
not a little puzzled by the steady and unembarrassed
air of his friend.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, thou most suspicious of coxcombs,&rdquo; said
Etherington, &ldquo;what the devil would you have me
say to you?&mdash;Can I, as the lawyers say, prove a
negative? or, is it not very possible, that such
things may exist, though I have never seen or
heard of them? All I can say is, that of all men I
am the most interested to deny the existence of
such documents; and, therefore, certainly will not
admit of it, unless I am compelled to do so by their
being produced; nor then either, unless I am at the
same time well assured of their authenticity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot blame you for your being hard of faith,
my lord,&rdquo; said Jekyl; &ldquo;but still I think if you can
cut out with your earldom, and your noble hereditary
estate, I would, in your case, pitch Nettlewood
to the devil.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, as you pitched your own patrimony, Jekyl;
but you took care to have the spending of it first.&mdash;What
would <i>you</i> give for such an opportunity of
piecing your fortunes by marriage?&mdash;Confess the
truth.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_193" id="vol_ii_Page_193">[Pg&nbsp;193]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I might be tempted, perhaps,&rdquo; said Jekyl, &ldquo;in
my present circumstances; but if they were what
they have been, I should despise an estate that was
to be held by petticoat tenure, especially when the
lady of the manor was a sickly fantastic girl, that
hated me, as this Miss Mowbray has the bad taste
to hate you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Umph&mdash;sickly?&mdash;no, no, she is not sickly&mdash;she
is as healthy as any one in constitution&mdash;and,
on my word, I think her paleness only renders
her more interesting. The last time I saw her, I
thought she might have rivalled one of Canova's
finest statues.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; but she is indifferent to you&mdash;you do not
love her,&rdquo; said Jekyl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is any thing but indifferent to me,&rdquo; said
the Earl; &ldquo;she becomes daily more interesting&mdash;for
her dislike piques me; and besides, she has the
insolence openly to defy and contemn me before her
brother, and in the eyes of all the world. I have
a kind of loving hatred&mdash;a sort of hating love for
her; in short, thinking upon her is like trying to
read a riddle, and makes one make quite as many
blunders, and talk just as much nonsense. If ever
I have the opportunity, I will make her pay for all
her airs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What airs?&rdquo; said Jekyl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, the devil may describe them, for I cannot;
but, for example&mdash;Since her brother has
insisted on her receiving me, or I should rather say
on her appearing when I visit Shaws-Castle, one
would think her invention has toiled in discovering
different ways of showing want of respect to me,
and dislike to my presence. Instead of dressing
herself as a lady should, especially on such occa<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_194" id="vol_ii_Page_194">[Pg&nbsp;194]</a></span>sions,
she chooses some fantastic, or old-fashioned,
or negligent bedizening, which makes her at least
look odd, if it cannot make her ridiculous&mdash;such
triple tiaras of various-coloured gauze on her head&mdash;such
pieces of old tapestry, I think, instead of
shawls and pelisses&mdash;such thick-soled shoes&mdash;such
tan-leather gloves&mdash;mercy upon us, Hal, the very
sight of her equipment would drive mad a whole
conclave of milliners! Then her postures are so
strange&mdash;she does so stoop and lollop, as the
women call it, so cross her legs and square her arms&mdash;were
the goddess of grace to look down on her,
it would put her to flight for ever!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you are willing to make this awkward,
ill-dressed, unmannered dowdy, your Countess,
Etherington; you, for whose critical eye half the
town dress themselves?&rdquo; said Jekyl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is all a trick, Hal&mdash;all an assumed character
to get rid of me, to disgust me, to baffle me; but I
am not to be had so easily. The brother is driven
to despair&mdash;he bites his nails, winks, coughs, makes
signs, which she always takes up at cross-purpose.&mdash;I
hope he beats her after I go away; there would
be a touch of consolation, were one but certain of
that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A very charitable hope, truly, and your present
feelings might lead the lady to judge what
she may expect after wedlock. But,&rdquo; added Jekyl,
&ldquo;cannot you, so skilful in fathoming every mood
of the female mind, divine some mode of engaging
her in conversation?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Conversation!&rdquo; replied the Earl; &ldquo;why, ever
since the shock of my first appearance was surmounted,
she has contrived to vote me a nonentity;
and that she may annihilate me completely, she has<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_195" id="vol_ii_Page_195">[Pg&nbsp;195]</a></span>
chosen, of all occupations, that of working a stocking!
From what cursed old antediluvian, who lived
before the invention of spinning-jennies, she learned
this craft, Heaven only knows; but there she sits,
with her work pinned to her knee&mdash;not the pretty
taper silken fabric, with which Jeannette of Amiens
coquetted, while Tristram Shandy was observing
her progress; but a huge worsted bag, designed
for some flat-footed old pauper, with heels like an
elephant&mdash;And there she squats, counting all the
stitches as she works, and refusing to speak, or
listen, or look up, under pretence that it disturbs
her calculation!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;An elegant occupation, truly, and I wonder it
does not work a cure upon her noble admirer,&rdquo; said
Jekyl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Confound her&mdash;no&mdash;she shall not trick me.
And then amid this affectation of vulgar stolidity,
there break out such sparkles of exultation, when
she thinks she has succeeded in baffling her brother,
and in plaguing me, that, by my faith, Hal, I could
not tell, were it at my option, whether to kiss or to
cuff her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are determined to go on with this strange
affair, then?&rdquo; said Jekyl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;On&mdash;on&mdash;on, my boy!&mdash;Clara and Nettlewood
for ever!&rdquo; answered the Earl. &ldquo;Besides this
brother of hers provokes me too&mdash;he does not do
for me half what he might&mdash;what he ought to do.
He stands on points of honour, forsooth, this broken-down
horse-jockey, who swallowed my two thousand
pounds as a pointer would a pat of butter.&mdash;I can
see he wishes to play fast and loose&mdash;has some
suspicions, like you, Hal, upon the strength of my
right to my father's titles and estate; as if, with<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_196" id="vol_ii_Page_196">[Pg&nbsp;196]</a></span>
the tithe of the Nettlewood property alone, I would
not be too good a match for one of his beggarly
family. He must scheme, forsooth, this half-baked
Scotch cake!&mdash;He must hold off and on, and be
cautious, and wait the result, and try conclusions
with me, this lump of oatmeal dough!&mdash;I am
much tempted to make an example of him in the
course of my proceedings.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, this is vengeance horrible and dire,&rdquo; said
Jekyl; &ldquo;yet I give up the brother to you; he is a
conceited coxcomb, and deserves a lesson. But I
would fain intercede for the sister.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We shall see&rdquo;&mdash;replied the Earl; and then
suddenly, &ldquo;I tell you what it is, Hal; her caprices
are so diverting, that I sometimes think out of
mere contradiction, I almost love her; at least, if
she would but clear old scores, and forget one
unlucky prank of mine, it should be her own fault
if I did not make her a happy woman.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_197" id="vol_ii_Page_197">[Pg&nbsp;197]</a></span></p>

<i>Old Play.</i><br />
</p>


<p>The general expectation of the company had been
disappointed by the pacific termination of the
meeting betwixt the Earl of Etherington and
Tyrrel, the anticipation of which had created so
deep a sensation. It had been expected that some
appalling scene would have taken place; instead of
which, each party seemed to acquiesce in a sullen
neutrality, and leave the war to be carried on by
their lawyers. It was generally understood that
the cause was removed out of the courts of Bellona
into that of Themis; and although the litigants
continued to inhabit the same neighbourhood, and
once or twice met at the public walks or public
table, they took no notice of each other, farther
than by exchanging on such occasions, a grave
and distant bow.</p>

<p>In the course of two or three days, people ceased
to take interest in a feud so coldly conducted; and
if they thought of it at all, it was but to wonder
that both the parties should persevere in residing
near the Spa, and in chilling, with their unsocial
behaviour, a party met together for the purposes
of health and amusement.<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_198" id="vol_ii_Page_198">[Pg&nbsp;198]</a></span></p>

<p>But the brothers, as the reader is aware, however
painful their occasional meetings might be, had the
strongest reasons to remain in each other's neighbourhood&mdash;Lord
Etherington to conduct his design
upon Miss Mowbray, Tyrrel to disconcert his plan,
if possible, and both to await the answer which
should be returned by the house in London, who
were depositaries of the papers left by the late Earl.</p>

<p>Jekyl, anxious to assist his friend as much as
possible, made in the meantime a visit to old
Touchwood at the Aultoun, expecting to find him
as communicative as he had formerly been on the
subject of the quarrel betwixt the brothers, and
trusting to discover, by dint of address, whence he
had derived his information concerning the affairs
of the noble house of Etherington. But the confidence
which he had been induced to expect on the
part of the old traveller was not reposed. Ferdinand
Mendez Pinto, as the Earl called him, had changed
his mind, or was not in the vein of communication.
The only proof of his confidence worth mentioning,
was his imparting to the young officer a valuable
receipt for concocting curry-powder.</p>

<p>Jekyl was therefore reduced to believe that
Touchwood, who appeared all his life to have been
a great intermeddler in other people's matters, had
puzzled out the information which he appeared to
possess of Lord Etherington's affairs, through some
of those obscure sources whence very important
secrets do frequently, to the astonishment and
confusion of those whom they concern, escape to
the public. He thought this the more likely, as
Touchwood was by no means critically nice in his
society, but was observed to converse as readily with
a gentleman's gentleman, as with the gentleman to<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_199" id="vol_ii_Page_199">[Pg&nbsp;199]</a></span>
whom he belonged, and with a lady's attendant, as
with the lady herself. He that will stoop to this sort
of society, who is fond of tattle, being at the same
time disposed to pay some consideration for gratification
of his curiosity, and not over scrupulous
respecting its accuracy, may always command a
great quantity of private anecdote. Captain Jekyl
naturally enough concluded, that this busy old man
became in some degree master of other people's
affairs by such correspondences as these; and he
could himself bear witness to his success in cross-examination,
as he had been surprised into an
avowal of the rencontre between the brothers, by
an insidious observation of the said Touchwood.
He reported, therefore, to the Earl, after this
interview, that, on the whole, he thought he had
no reason to fear much on the subject of the
traveller, who, though he had become acquainted,
by some means or other, with some leading facts
of his remarkable history; only possessed them in
a broken, confused, and desultory manner, insomuch
that he seemed to doubt whether the parties in the
expected lawsuit were brothers or cousins, and
appeared totally ignorant of the facts on which it
was to be founded.</p>

<p>It was the next day after this <i>&eacute;claircissement</i> on
the subject of Touchwood, that Lord Etherington
dropped as usual into the bookseller's shop, got
his papers, and skimming his eye over the shelf
on which lay, till called for, the postponed letters
destined for the Aultoun, saw with a beating heart
the smart post-mistress toss amongst them, with an
air of sovereign contempt, a pretty large packet,
addressed to Francis Tyrrel, Esq. &amp;c. He withdrew
his eyes, as if conscious that even to have looked<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_200" id="vol_ii_Page_200">[Pg&nbsp;200]</a></span>
on this important parcel might engender some
suspicion of his purpose, or intimate the deep
interest which he took in the contents of the
missive which was so slightly treated by his friend
Mrs. Pott. At this moment the door of the shop
opened, and Lady Penelope Penfeather entered,
with her eternal <i>pendante</i>, the little Miss Digges.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you seen Mr. Mowbray?&mdash;Has Mr.
Mowbray of St. Ronan's been down this morning?&mdash;Do
you know any thing of Mr. Mowbray, Mrs.
Pott?&rdquo; were questions which the lettered lady
eagerly huddled on the back of each other, scarcely
giving time to the lady of letters to return a decided
negative to all and each of them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Mowbray was not about&mdash;was not coming
there this morning&mdash;his servant had just called for
letters and papers, and announced as much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good Heaven! how unfortunate!&rdquo; said Lady
Penelope, with a deep sigh, and sinking down on
one of the little sofas in an attitude of shocking
desolation, which called the instant attention of Mr.
Pott and his good woman, the first uncorking a
small phial of salts, for he was a pharmacopolist as
well as vender of literature and transmitter of letters,
and the other hastening for a glass of water.
A strong temptation thrilled from Lord Etherington's
eyes to his finger-ends. Two steps might
have brought him within arm's-length of the
unwatched packet, on the contents of which, in all
probability, rested the hope and claims of his rival
in honour and fortune; and, in the general confusion,
was it impossible to possess himself of it
unobserved? But no&mdash;no&mdash;no&mdash;the attempt was
too dreadfully dangerous to be risked; and, passing
from one extreme to another, he felt as if he was<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_201" id="vol_ii_Page_201">[Pg&nbsp;201]</a></span>
incurring suspicion by suffering Lady Penelope to
play off her airs of affected distress and anxiety,
without seeming to take that interest in them which
her rank at least might be supposed to demand.
Stung with this apprehension, he hastened to
express himself so anxiously on the subject, and to
demonstrate so busily his wish to assist her ladyship,
that he presently stood committed a great
deal farther than he had intended. Lady Penelope
was infinitely obliged to his lordship&mdash;indeed,
it was her character in general not to permit herself
to be overcome by circumstances; but something
had happened, so strange, so embarrassing, so melancholy,
that she owned it had quite overcome her&mdash;notwithstanding,
she had at all times piqued
herself on supporting her own distresses, better
than she was able to suppress her emotions in
viewing those of others.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Could he be of any use?&rdquo; Lord Etherington
asked. &ldquo;She had enquired after Mr. Mowbray of St.
Ronan's&mdash;his servant was at her ladyship's service,
if she chose to send to command his attendance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! no, no!&rdquo; said Lady Penelope; &ldquo;I dare
say, my dear lord, you will answer the purpose a
great deal better than Mr. Mowbray&mdash;that is, provided
you are a Justice of Peace.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A Justice of Peace!&rdquo; said Lord Etherington,
much surprised; &ldquo;I am in the commission unquestionably,
but not for any Scotch county.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, that does not signify,&rdquo; said Lady Penelope;
&ldquo;and if you will trust yourself with me a little way,
I will explain to you how you can do one of the
most charitable, and kind, and generous things in
the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lord Etherington's delight in the exercise of<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_202" id="vol_ii_Page_202">[Pg&nbsp;202]</a></span>
charity, kindness, and generosity, was not so exuberant
as to prevent his devising some means for
evading Lady Penelope's request, when, looking
through the sash-door, he had a distant glance of
his servant Solmes approaching the Post-office.</p>

<p>I have heard of a sheep-stealer who had rendered
his dog so skilful an accomplice in his nefarious
traffic, that he used to send him out to commit acts
of felony by himself, and had even contrived to
impress on the poor cur the caution that he should
not, on such occasions, seem even to recognise his
master, if they met accidentally.<a name="vol_ii_FNanchor_9_9" id="vol_ii_FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#vol_ii_Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Apparently, Lord
Etherington conducted himself upon a similar principle;
for he had no sooner a glimpse of his agent,
than he seemed to feel the necessity of leaving the
stage free for his machinations.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My servant,&rdquo; he said, with as much indifference
as he could assume, &ldquo;will call for my letters&mdash;I
must attend Lady Penelope;&rdquo; and, instantly proffering
his services as Justice of the Peace, or in
whatever other quality she chose to employ them,
he hastily presented his arm, and scarce gave her
ladyship time to recover from her state of languor
to the necessary degree of activity, ere he hurried
her from the shop; and, with her thin hatchet-face
chattering close to his ear, her yellow and scarlet
feathers crossing his nose, her lean right honourable
arm hooking his elbow, he braved the suppressed
titters and sneers of all the younger women whom
he met as they traversed the parade. One glance
of intelligence, though shot at a distance, passed
betwixt his lordship and Solmes, as the former left
the public walk under the guidance of Lady
Penelope, his limbs indeed obeying her pleasure,<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_203" id="vol_ii_Page_203">[Pg&nbsp;203]</a></span>
and his ears dinned with her attempts to explain the
business in question, but his mind totally indifferent
where he was going, or ignorant on what
purpose, and exclusively occupied with the packet
in Mrs. Pott's heap of postponed letters, and its
probable fate.</p>

<p>At length an effort of recollection made Lord
Etherington sensible that his abstraction must
seem strange, and, as his conscience told him, even
suspicious in the eyes of his companion; putting
therefore the necessary degree of constraint upon
himself, he expressed, for the first time, curiosity
to know where their walk was to terminate. It
chanced, that this was precisely the question which
he needed not to have asked, if he had paid but the
slightest attention to the very voluble communications
of her ladyship, which had all turned upon
this subject.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, my dear lord,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I must believe
you lords of the creation think us poor simple women
the vainest fools alive. I have told you how much
pain it costs me to speak about my little charities,
and yet you come to make me tell you the whole
story over again. But I hope, after all, your lordship
is not surprised at what I have thought it my
duty to do in this sad affair&mdash;perhaps I have listened
too much to the dictates of my own heart, which are
apt to be so deceitful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On the watch to get at something explanatory,
yet afraid, by demanding it directly, to show that
the previous tide of narrative and pathos had been
lost on an inattentive ear, Lord Etherington could
only say, that Lady Penelope could not err in
acting according to the dictates of her own
judgment.<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_204" id="vol_ii_Page_204">[Pg&nbsp;204]</a></span></p>

<p>Still the compliment had not sauce enough for
the lady's sated palate; so, like a true glutton of
praise, she began to help herself with the soup-ladle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! judgment?&mdash;how is it you men know us
so little, that you think we can pause to weigh sentiment
in the balance of judgment?&mdash;that is
expecting rather too much from us poor victims of
our feelings. So that you must really hold me
excused if I forgot the errors of this guilty and
unhappy creature, when I looked upon her wretchedness&mdash;Not
that I would have my little friend,
Miss Digges, or your lordship, suppose that I am
capable of palliating the fault, while I pity the poor,
miserable sinner. Oh, no&mdash;Walpole's verses express
beautifully what one ought to feel on such
occasions&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&lsquo;For never was the gentle breast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Insensible to human woes;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Feeling, though firm, it melts distress'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For weaknesses it never knows.&rsquo;&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>&ldquo;Most accursed of all <i>pr&eacute;cieuses</i>,&rdquo; thought his
lordship, &ldquo;when wilt thou, amidst all thy chatter,
utter one word sounding like sense or information!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But, Lady Penelope went on&mdash;&ldquo;If you knew,
my lord, how I lament my limited means on those
occasions! but I have gathered something among
the good people at the Well. I asked that selfish
wretch, Winterblossom, to walk down with me to
view her distress, and the heartless beast told me
he was afraid of infection!&mdash;infection from a puer&mdash;puerperal
fever! I should not perhaps pronounce
the word, but science is of no sex&mdash;however, I have
always used thieves' vinegar essence, and never have
gone farther than the threshold.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_205" id="vol_ii_Page_205">[Pg&nbsp;205]</a></span></p>

<p>Whatever were Etherington's faults, he did not
want charity, so far as it consists in giving alms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sorry,&rdquo; he said, taking out his purse,
&ldquo;your ladyship should not have applied to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pardon me, my lord, we only beg from our
friends; and your lordship is so constantly engaged
with Lady Binks, that we have rarely the pleasure
of seeing you in what I call <i>my</i> little circle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lord Etherington, without further answer, tendered
a couple of guineas, and observed, that the
poor woman should have medical attendance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, so I say,&rdquo; answered Lady Penelope;
&ldquo;and I asked the brute Quackleben, who, I am
sure, owes me some gratitude, to go and see her;
but the sordid monster answered, &lsquo;Who was to pay
him?&rsquo;&mdash;He grows every day more intolerable, now
that he seems sure of marrying that fat blowzy
widow. He could not, I am sure, expect that I&mdash;out
of my pittance&mdash;And besides, my lord, is there
not a law that the parish, or the county, or the
something or other, shall pay for physicking the
poor?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will find means to secure the Doctor's
attendance,&rdquo; said Lord Etherington; &ldquo;and I believe
my best way will be to walk back to the Well, and
send him to wait on the patient. I am afraid I can
be of little use to a poor woman in a childbed fever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Puerperal, my lord, puerperal,&rdquo; said Lady
Penelope, in a tone of correction.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In a puerperal fever, then,&rdquo; said Lord Etherington;
&ldquo;why, what can I do to help her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! my lord, you have forgotten that this
Anne Heggie, that I told you of, came here with
one child in her arms&mdash;and another&mdash;in short, about
to become a mother again&mdash;and settled herself in<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_206" id="vol_ii_Page_206">[Pg&nbsp;206]</a></span>
this miserable hut I told you of&mdash;and some people
think the minister should have sent her to her own
parish; but he is a strange, soft-headed, sleepy sort
of man, not over active in his parochial duties.
However, there she settled, and there was something
about her quite beyond the style of a common
pauper, my lord&mdash;not at all the disgusting sort of
person that you give a sixpence to while you look
another way&mdash;but some one that seemed to have
seen better days&mdash;one that, as Shakspeare says,
could a tale unfold&mdash;though, indeed, I have never
thoroughly learned her history&mdash;only, that to-day,
as I called to know how she was, and sent my maid
into her hut with some trifle, not worth mentioning,
I find there is something hangs about her mind concerning
the Mowbray family here of St. Ronan's&mdash;and
my woman says the poor creature is dying, and
is raving either for Mr. Mowbray or for some magistrate
to receive a declaration; and so I have given
you the trouble to come with me, that we may
get out of the poor creature, if possible, whatever
she has got to say.&mdash;I hope it is not murder&mdash;I hope
not&mdash;though young St. Ronan's has been a strange,
wild, daring, thoughtless creature&mdash;<i>sgherro insigne</i>,
as the Italian says.&mdash;But here is the hut, my lord&mdash;pray,
walk in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The mention of the St. Ronan's family, and of a
secret relating to them, banished the thoughts which
Lord Etherington began to entertain of leaving
Lady Penelope to execute her works of devoted
charity without his assistance. It was now with an
interest equal to her own, that he stood before a most
miserable hut, where the unfortunate female, her
distresses not greatly relieved by Lady Penelope's
ostentatious bounty, had resided both previous to<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_207" id="vol_ii_Page_207">[Pg&nbsp;207]</a></span>
her confinement, and since that event had taken
place, with an old woman, one of the parish poor,
whose miserable dole the minister had augmented,
that she might have some means of assisting the
stranger.</p>

<p>Lady Penelope lifted the latch and entered, after
a momentary hesitation, which proceeded from a
struggle betwixt her fear of infection, and her eager
curiosity to know something, she could not guess
what, that might affect the Mowbrays in their
honour or fortunes. The latter soon prevailed, and
she entered, followed by Lord Etherington. The
lady, like other comforters of the cabins of the poor,
proceeded to rebuke the grumbling old woman for
want of order and cleanliness&mdash;censured the food
which was provided for the patient, and enquired
particularly after the wine which she had left to
make caudle with. The crone was not so dazzled
with Lady Penelope's dignity or bounty as to
endure her reprimand with patience. &ldquo;They that
had their bread to won wi' ae arm,&rdquo; she said, for
the other hung powerless by her side, &ldquo;had mair
to do than to soop hooses; if her leddyship wad let
her ain idle quean of a lass take the besom, she
might make the house as clean as she liked; and
madam wad be a' the better of the exercise, and
wad hae done, at least, ae turn of wark at the
week's end.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you hear the old hag, my lord?&rdquo; said Lady
Penelope. &ldquo;Well, the poor are horrid ungrateful
wretches&mdash;And the wine, dame&mdash;the wine?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The wine!&mdash;there was hardly half a mutchkin,
and puir, thin, fusionless skink it was&mdash;the wine
was drank out, ye may swear&mdash;we didna fling it
ower our shouther&mdash;if ever we were to get good<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_208" id="vol_ii_Page_208">[Pg&nbsp;208]</a></span>
o't, it was by taking it naked, and no wi' your sugar
and your slaisters&mdash;I wish, for ane, I had ne'er kend
the sour smack o't. If the bedral hadna gien me
a drap of usquebaugh, I might e'en hae died of your
leddyship's liquor, for&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Lord Etherington here interrupted the grumbling
crone, thrusting some silver into her grasp,
and at the same time begging her to be silent.
The hag weighed the crown-piece in her hand, and
crawled to her chimney-corner, muttering as she
went,&mdash;&ldquo;This is something like&mdash;this is something
like&mdash;no like rinning into the house and out of the
house, and geeing orders, like mistress and mair, and
than a puir shilling again Saturday at e'en.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So saying, she sat down to her wheel, and seized,
while she spun, her jet-black cutty pipe, from which
she soon sent such clouds of vile mundungus vapour
as must have cleared the premises of Lady Penelope,
had she not been strong in purpose to share
the expected confession of the invalid. As for Miss
Digges, she coughed, sneezed, retched, and finally
ran out of the cottage, declaring she could not live
in such a smoke, if it were to hear twenty sick
women's last speeches; and that, besides, she was
sure to know all about it from Lady Penelope, if it
was ever so little worth telling over again.</p>

<p>Lord Etherington was now standing beside the
miserable flock-bed, in which lay the poor patient,
distracted, in what seemed to be her dying moments,
with the peevish clamour of the elder infant, to
which she could only reply by low moans, turning
her looks as well as she could from its ceaseless
whine to the other side of her wretched couch,
where lay the unlucky creature to which she had
last given birth; its shivering limbs imperfectly<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_209" id="vol_ii_Page_209">[Pg&nbsp;209]</a></span>
covered with a blanket, its little features already
swollen and bloated, and its eyes scarce open,
apparently insensible to the evils of a state from
which it seemed about to be speedily released.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are very ill, poor woman,&rdquo; said Lord
Etherington; &ldquo;I am told you desire a magistrate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was Mr. Mowbray of St. Ronan's, whom I
desired to see&mdash;John Mowbray of St. Ronan's&mdash;the
lady promised to bring him here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not Mowbray of St. Ronan's,&rdquo; said Lord
Etherington; &ldquo;but I am a justice of peace, and a
member of the legislature&mdash;I am, moreover, Mr.
Mowbray's particular friend, if I can be of use to
you in any of these capacities.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The poor woman remained long silent, and when
she spoke it was doubtfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is my Lady Penelope Penfeather there?&rdquo; she
said, straining her darkened eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Her ladyship is present, and within hearing,&rdquo;
said Lord Etherington.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My case is the worse,&rdquo; answered the dying
woman, for so she seemed, &ldquo;if I must communicate
such a secret as mine to a man of whom I know
nothing, and a woman of whom I only know that
she wants discretion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I want discretion!&rdquo; said Lady Penelope;
but at a signal from Lord Etherington she seemed
to restrain herself; nor did the sick woman, whose
powers of observation were greatly impaired, seem
to be aware of the interruption. She spoke, notwithstanding
her situation, with an intelligible and
even emphatic voice; her manner in a great measure
betraying the influence of the fever, and her
tone and language seeming much superior to her
most miserable condition.<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_210" id="vol_ii_Page_210">[Pg&nbsp;210]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not the abject creature which I seem,&rdquo;
she said; &ldquo;at least, I was not born to be so. I
wish I <i>were</i> that utter abject! I wish I were a
wretched pauper of the lowest class&mdash;a starving
vagabond&mdash;a wifeless mother&mdash;ignorance and
insensibility would make me bear my lot like the
outcast animal that dies patiently on the side of the
common, where it has been half-starved during its
life. But I&mdash;but I&mdash;born and bred to better things,
have not lost the memory of them, and they make
my present condition&mdash;my shame&mdash;my poverty&mdash;my
infamy&mdash;the sight of my dying babes&mdash;the
sense that my own death is coming fast on&mdash;they
make these things a foretaste of hell!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lady Penelope's self-conceit and affectation were
broken down by this fearful exordium. She sobbed,
shuddered, and, for once perhaps in her life, felt the
real, not the assumed necessity, of putting her handkerchief
to her eyes. Lord Etherington also was
moved.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good woman,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;as far as relieving
your personal wants can mitigate your distress, I
will see that that is fully performed, and that your
poor children are attended to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;May God bless you!&rdquo; said the poor woman,
with a glance at the wretched forms beside her;
&ldquo;and may you,&rdquo; she added, after a momentary
pause, &ldquo;deserve the blessing of God, for it is
bestowed in vain on those who are unworthy of it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lord Etherington felt, perhaps, a twinge of conscience;
for he said, something hastily, &ldquo;Pray go
on, good woman, if you really have any thing to
communicate to me as a magistrate&mdash;it is time
your condition was somewhat mended, and I will
cause you to be cared for directly.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_211" id="vol_ii_Page_211">[Pg&nbsp;211]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop yet a moment,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;let me unload
my conscience before I go hence, for no earthly
relief will long avail to prolong my time here.&mdash;I
was well born, the more my present shame! well
educated, the greater my present guilt!&mdash;I was
always, indeed, poor, but I felt not of the ills of
poverty. I only thought of it when my vanity
demanded idle and expensive gratifications, for real
wants I knew none. I was companion of a young
lady of higher rank than my own, my relative
however, and one of such exquisite kindness of
disposition, that she treated me as a sister, and
would have shared with me all that she had on
earth&mdash;&mdash;I scarce think I can go farther with
my story!&mdash;something rises to my throat when I
recollect how I rewarded her sisterly love!&mdash;I was
elder than Clara&mdash;I should have directed her reading,
and confirmed her understanding; but my own
bent led me to peruse only works, which, though
they burlesque nature, are seductive to the imagination.
We read these follies together, until we
had fashioned out for ourselves a little world of
romance, and prepared ourselves for a maze of
adventures. Clara's imaginations were as pure as
those of angels; mine were&mdash;but it is unnecessary to
tell them. The fiend, always watchful, presented a
tempter at the moment when it was most dangerous.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She paused here, as if she found difficulty in
expressing herself; and Lord Etherington, turning,
with great appearance of interest, to Lady Penelope,
began to enquire, &ldquo;Whether it were quite agreeable
to her ladyship to remain any longer an ear-witness
of this unfortunate's confession?&mdash;it seems to be
verging on some things&mdash;things that it might
be unpleasant for your ladyship to hear.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_212" id="vol_ii_Page_212">[Pg&nbsp;212]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I was just forming the same opinion, my lord;
and, to say truth, was about to propose to your lordship
to withdraw, and leave me alone with the poor
woman. My sex will make her necessary communications
more frank in your lordship's absence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;True, madam; but then I am called here in
my capacity of a magistrate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; said Lady Penelope; &ldquo;she speaks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They say every woman that yields, makes herself
a slave to her seducer; but I sold my liberty
not to a man, but a demon! He made me serve
him in his vile schemes against my friend and
patroness&mdash;and oh! he found in me an agent too
willing, from mere envy, to destroy the virtue
which I had lost myself. Do not listen to me any
more&mdash;Go, and leave me to my fate! I am the
most detestable wretch that ever lived&mdash;detestable
to myself worst of all, because even in my penitence
there is a secret whisper that tells me, that were I
as I have been, I would again act over all the wickedness
I have done, and much worse. Oh! for
Heaven's assistance, to crush the wicked thought!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She closed her eyes, folded her emaciated hands,
and held them upwards in the attitude of one who
prays internally; presently the hands separated, and
fell gently down on the miserable couch; but her
eyes did not open, nor was there the slightest sign
of motion in the features. Lady Penelope shrieked
faintly, hid her eyes, and hurried back from the bed,
while Lord Etherington, his looks darkening with
a complication of feelings, remained gazing on the
poor woman, as if eager to discern whether the
spark of life was totally extinct. Her grim old
assistant hurried to the bedside, with some spirits
in a broken glass.<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_213" id="vol_ii_Page_213">[Pg&nbsp;213]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Have ye no had pennyworths for your charity?&rdquo;
she said, in spiteful scorn. &ldquo;Ye buy the
very life o' us wi' your shillings and sixpences,
your groats and your boddles&mdash;ye hae garr'd the
puir wretch speak till she swarfs, and now ye
stand as if ye never saw a woman in a dwam
before? Let me till her wi' the dram&mdash;mony
words mickle drought, ye ken&mdash;Stand out o' my
gate, my leddy, if sae be that ye are a leddy;
there is little use of the like of you when there
is death in the pot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lady Penelope, half affronted, but still more
frightened by the manners of the old hag, now
gladly embraced Lord Etherington's renewed offer
to escort her from the hut. He left it not, however,
without bestowing an additional gratuity on
the old woman, who received it with a whining
benediction.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Almighty guide your course through the
troubles of this wicked warld&mdash;and the muckle
deevil blaw wind in your sails,&rdquo; she added, in her
natural tone, as the guests vanished from her
miserable threshold. &ldquo;A wheen cork-headed,
barmy-brained gowks! that wunna let puir folk
sae muckle as die in quiet, wi' their sossings and
their soopings.&rdquo;<a name="vol_ii_FNanchor_10_10" id="vol_ii_FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#vol_ii_Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>&ldquo;This poor creature's declaration,&rdquo; said Lord
Etherington to Lady Penelope, &ldquo;seems to refer to
matters which the law has nothing to do with,
and which, perhaps, as they seem to implicate the
peace of a family of respectability, and the character
of a young lady, we ought to enquire no
farther after.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I differ from your lordship,&rdquo; said Lady Penelope;<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_214" id="vol_ii_Page_214">[Pg&nbsp;214]</a></span>
&ldquo;I differ extremely&mdash;I suppose you guess whom
her discourse touched upon?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed, your ladyship does my acuteness too
much honour.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did she not mention a Christian name?&rdquo; said
Lady Penelope; &ldquo;your lordship is strangely dull
this morning!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A Christian name?&mdash;No, none that I heard&mdash;yes,
she said something about&mdash;a Catherine, I think
it was.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Catherine!&rdquo; answered the lady; &ldquo;No, my lord,
it was Clara&mdash;rather a rare name in this country,
and belonging, I think, to a young lady of whom
your lordship should know something, unless your
evening flirtations with Lady Binks have blotted
entirely out of your memory your morning visits to
Shaws-Castle. You are a bold man, my lord. I
would advise you to include Mrs. Blower among the
objects of your attention, and then you will have
maid, wife, and widow upon your list.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Upon my honour, your ladyship is too severe,&rdquo;
said Lord Etherington; &ldquo;you surround yourself
every evening with all that is clever and accomplished
among the people here, and then you ridicule
a poor secluded monster, who dare not approach
your charmed circle, because he seeks for some
amusement elsewhere. This is to tyrannize and
not to reign&mdash;it is Turkish despotism!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! my lord, I know you well, my lord,&rdquo; said
Lady Penelope&mdash;&ldquo;Sorry would your lordship be,
had you not power to render yourself welcome to
any circle which you may please to approach.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is to say,&rdquo; answered the lord, &ldquo;you will
pardon me if I intrude on your ladyship's coterie
this evening?&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_215" id="vol_ii_Page_215">[Pg&nbsp;215]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;There is no society which Lord Etherington
can think of frequenting, where he will not be a
welcome guest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will plead then at once my pardon and privilege
this evening&mdash;And now,&rdquo; (speaking as if he
had succeeded in establishing some confidence with
her ladyship,) &ldquo;what do you really think of this
blind story?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, I must believe it concerns Miss Mowbray.
She was always an odd girl&mdash;something about her
I could never endure&mdash;a sort of effrontery&mdash;that
is, perhaps, a harsh word, but a kind of assurance&mdash;an
air of confidence&mdash;so that though I kept on a
footing with her, because she was an orphan girl
of good family, and because I really knew nothing
positively bad of her, yet she sometimes absolutely
shocked me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your ladyship, perhaps, would not think it
right to give publicity to the story? at least, till
you know exactly what it is,&rdquo; said the Earl, in a
tone of suggestion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Depend upon it, that it is quite the worst, the
very worst&mdash;You heard the woman say that she had
exposed Clara to ruin&mdash;and you know she must
have meant Clara Mowbray, because she was so
anxious to tell the story to her brother, St.
Ronan's.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very true&mdash;I did not think of that,&rdquo; answered
Lord Etherington; &ldquo;still it would be hard on the
poor girl if it should get abroad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, it will never get abroad for me,&rdquo; said Lady
Penelope; &ldquo;I would not tell the very wind of it.
But then I cannot meet Miss Mowbray as formerly&mdash;I
have a station in life to maintain, my lord&mdash;and
I am under the necessity of being select in my<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_216" id="vol_ii_Page_216">[Pg&nbsp;216]</a></span>
society&mdash;it is a duty I owe the public, if it were
even not my own inclination.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly, my Lady Penelope,&rdquo; said Lord
Etherington; &ldquo;but then consider, that, in a place
where all eyes are necessarily observant of your
ladyship's behaviour, the least coldness on your part
to Miss Mowbray&mdash;and, after all, we have nothing
like assurance of any thing being wrong there&mdash;would
ruin her with the company here, and with
the world at large.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! my lord,&rdquo; answered Lady Penelope, &ldquo;as
for the truth of the story, I have some private reasons
of my own for &lsquo;holding the strange tale
devoutly true;&rsquo; for I had a mysterious hint from
a very worthy, but a very singular man, (your
lordship knows how I adore originality,) the clergyman
of the parish, who made me aware there was
something wrong about Miss Clara&mdash;something
that&mdash;your lordship will excuse my speaking
more plainly,&mdash;Oh, no!&mdash;I fear&mdash;I fear it is all
too true&mdash;You know Mr. Cargill, I suppose, my
lord?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;no&mdash;I&mdash;I think I have seen him,&rdquo; said
Lord Etherington. &ldquo;But how came the lady to
make the parson her father-confessor?&mdash;they have
no auricular confession in the Kirk&mdash;it must have
been with the purpose of marriage, I presume&mdash;let
us hope that it took place&mdash;perhaps it really was
so&mdash;did he, Cargill&mdash;the minister, I mean&mdash;say
any thing of such a matter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a word&mdash;not a word&mdash;I see where you
are, my lord; you would put a good face on't.&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&lsquo;They call'd it marriage, by that specious name<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To veil the crime, and sanctify the shame.&rsquo;<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_217" id="vol_ii_Page_217">[Pg&nbsp;217]</a></span></div></div>

<p>Queen Dido for that. How the clergyman came
into the secret I cannot tell&mdash;he is a very close
man. But I know he will not hear of Miss Mowbray
being married to any one, unquestionably
because he knows that, in doing so, she would
introduce disgrace into some honest family&mdash;and,
truly, I am much of his mind, my lord.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps Mr. Cargill may know the lady is privately
married already,&rdquo; said the Earl; &ldquo;I think
that is the more natural inference, begging your
ladyship's pardon for presuming to differ in opinion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lady Penelope seemed determined not to take
this view of the case.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no&mdash;no, I tell you,&rdquo; she replied; &ldquo;she
cannot be married, for if she were married, how
could the poor wretch say that she was ruined?&mdash;You
know there is a difference betwixt ruin and
marriage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some people are said to have found them synonymous,
Lady Penelope,&rdquo; answered the Earl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are smart on me, my lord; but still, in
common parlance, when we say a woman is ruined,
we mean quite the contrary of her being married&mdash;it
is impossible for me to be more explicit upon
such a topic, my lord.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I defer to your ladyship's better judgment,&rdquo;
said Lord Etherington. &ldquo;I only entreat you to
observe a little caution in this business&mdash;I will
make the strictest enquiries of this woman, and
acquaint you with the result; and I hope, out of
regard to the respectable family of St. Ronan's, your
ladyship will be in no hurry to intimate any thing
to Miss Mowbray's prejudice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I certainly am no person to spread scandal,
my lord,&rdquo; answered the lady, drawing herself up;<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_218" id="vol_ii_Page_218">[Pg&nbsp;218]</a></span>
&ldquo;at the same time, I must say, the Mowbrays have
little claim on me for forbearance. I am sure I
was the first person to bring this Spa into fashion,
which has been a matter of such consequence to
their estate; and yet Mr. Mowbray set himself
against me, my lord, in every possible sort of way,
and encouraged the under-bred people about him
to behave very strangely.&mdash;There was the business
of building the Belvidere, which he would not permit
to be done out of the stock-purse of the company,
because I had given the workmen the plan and the
orders&mdash;and then, about the tea-room&mdash;and the
hour for beginning dancing&mdash;and about the subscription
for Mr. Rymour's new Tale of Chivalry&mdash;in
short, I owe no consideration to Mr. Mowbray
of St. Ronan's.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But the poor young lady?&rdquo; said Lord
Etherington.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! the poor young lady?&mdash;the poor young
lady can be as saucy as a rich young lady, I promise
you.&mdash;There was a business in which she used
me scandalously, Lord Etherington&mdash;it was about
a very trifling matter&mdash;a shawl. Nobody minds
dress less than I do, my lord; I thank Heaven my
thoughts turn upon very different topics&mdash;but it is
in trifles that disrespect and unkindness are shown;
and I have had a full share of both from Miss Clara,
besides a good deal of impertinence from her brother
upon the same subject.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is but one way remains,&rdquo; thought the
Earl, as they approached the Spa, &ldquo;and that is to
work on the fears of this d&mdash;d vindictive blue-stocking'd
wild-cat.&mdash;Your ladyship,&rdquo; he said aloud, &ldquo;is
aware what severe damages have been awarded in
late cases where something approaching to scandal<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_219" id="vol_ii_Page_219">[Pg&nbsp;219]</a></span>
has been traced to ladies of consideration&mdash;the
privileges of the tea-table have been found insufficient
to protect some fair critics against the consequences
of too frank and liberal animadversion upon the
characters of their friends. So pray, remember, that
as yet we know very little on this subject.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lady Penelope loved money, and feared the law;
and this hint, fortified by her acquaintance with
Mowbray's love of his sister, and his irritable and
revengeful disposition, brought her in a moment
much nearer the temper in which Lord Etherington
wished to leave her. She protested, that no one
could be more tender than she of the fame of the
unfortunate, even supposing their guilt was fully
proved&mdash;promised caution on the subject of the
pauper's declaration, and hoped Lord Etherington
would join her tea-party early in the evening, as
she wished to make him acquainted with one or two
of her <i>proteg&eacute;s</i>, whom, she was sure, his lordship
would find deserving of his advice and countenance.
Being by this time at the door of her own apartment,
her ladyship took leave of the Earl with a
most gracious smile.<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_220" id="vol_ii_Page_220">[Pg&nbsp;220]</a></span></p>

<i>The Storm.</i><br />
</p>


<p>&ldquo;It darkens round me like a tempest,&rdquo; thought Lord
Etherington, as, with slow step, folded arms, and
his white hat slouched over his brows, he traversed
the short interval of space betwixt his own apartments
and those of the Lady Penelope. In a buck
of the old school, one of Congreve's men of wit
and pleasure about town, this would have been a
departure from character; but the present fine
man does not derogate from his quality, even by
exhibiting all the moody and gentlemanlike solemnity
of Master Stephen.<a name="vol_ii_FNanchor_C_15" id="vol_ii_FNanchor_C_15"></a><a href="#vol_ii_Footnote_C_15" class="fnanchor">[C]</a> So, Lord Etherington
was at liberty to carry on his reflections, without
attracting observation.&mdash;&ldquo;I have put a stopper
into the mouth of that old vinegar-cruet of quality,
but the acidity of her temper will soon dissolve the
charm&mdash;And what to do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>As he looked round him, he saw his trusty valet
Solmes, who, touching his hat with due respect, said,
as he passed him, &ldquo;Your lordship's letters are in
your private dispatch-box.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Simple as these words were, and indifferent the
tone in which they were spoken, their import made<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_221" id="vol_ii_Page_221">[Pg&nbsp;221]</a></span>
Lord Etherington's heart bound as if his fate had
depended on the accents. He intimated no farther
interest in the communication, however, than to
desire Solmes to be below, in case he should ring;
and with these words entered his apartment, and
barred and bolted the door, even before he looked
on the table where his dispatch-box was placed.</p>

<p>Lord Etherington had, as is usual, one key to the
box which held his letters, his confidential servant
being intrusted with the other; so that, under the
protection of a patent lock, his dispatches escaped
all risk of being tampered with,&mdash;a precaution not
altogether unnecessary on the part of those who
frequent hotels and lodging-houses.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By your leave, Mr. Bramah,&rdquo; said the Earl, as
he applied the key, jesting, as it were, with his own
agitation, as he would have done with that of a
third party. The lid was raised, and displayed the
packet, the appearance and superscription of which
had attracted his observation but a short while
before in the post-office. <i>Then</i> he would have
given much to be possessed of the opportunity
which was now in his power; but many pause on
the brink of a crime, who have contemplated it at
a distance without scruple. Lord Etherington's
first impulse had led him to poke the fire; and he
held in his hand the letter which he was more than
half tempted to commit, without even breaking the
seal, to the fiery element. But, though sufficiently
familiarized with guilt, he was not as yet acquainted
with it in its basest shapes&mdash;he had not yet acted
with meanness, or at least with what the world
terms such. He had been a duellist, the manners
of the age authorized it&mdash;a libertine, the world
excused it to his youth and condition&mdash;a bold<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_222" id="vol_ii_Page_222">[Pg&nbsp;222]</a></span>
and successful gambler, for that quality he was
admired and envied; and a thousand other inaccuracies,
to which these practices and habits lead,
were easily slurred over in a man of quality, with
fortune and spirit to support his rank. But his
present meditated act was of a different kind. Tell
it not in Bond Street, whisper it not on St. James's
pavement!&mdash;it amounted to an act of petty larceny,
for which the code of honour would admit
of no composition.</p>

<p>Lord Etherington, under the influence of these
recollections, stood for a few minutes suspended&mdash;But
the devil always finds logic to convince his followers.
He recollected the wrong done to his
mother, and to himself, her offspring, to whom his
father had, in the face of the whole world, imparted
the hereditary rights, of which he was now, by a
posthumous deed, endeavouring to deprive the
memory of the one and the expectations of the
other. Surely, the right being his own, he had a
full title, by the most effectual means, whatever
such means might be, to repel all attacks on that
right, and even destroy, if necessary, the documents
by which his enemies were prosecuting their unjust
plans against his honour and interest.</p>

<p>This reasoning prevailed, and Lord Etherington
again held the devoted packet above the flames;
when it occurred to him, that, his resolution being
taken, he ought to carry it into execution as effectually
as possible; and to do so, it was necessary to
know, that the packet actually contained the papers
which he was desirous to destroy.</p>

<p>Never did a doubt arise in juster time; for no
sooner had the seal burst, and the envelope rustled
under his fingers, than he perceived, to his utter<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_223" id="vol_ii_Page_223">[Pg&nbsp;223]</a></span>
consternation, that he held in his hand only the
copies of the deeds for which Francis Tyrrel had
written, the originals of which he had too sanguinely
concluded would be forwarded according to
his requisition. A letter from a partner of the house
with which they were deposited, stated, that they
had not felt themselves at liberty, in the absence of
the head of their firm, to whom these papers had
been committed, to part with them even to Mr.
Tyrrel, though they had proceeded so far as to open
the parcel, and now transmitted to him formal copies
of the papers contained in it, which, they presumed,
would serve Mr. Tyrrel's purpose for consulting
counsel, or the like. They themselves, in a case of so
much delicacy, and in the absence of their principal
partner, were determined to retain the originals,
unless called to produce them in a court of justice.</p>

<p>With a solemn imprecation on the formality and
absurdity of the writer, Lord Etherington let the
letter of advice drop from his hand into the fire,
and throwing himself into a chair, passed his hand
across his eyes, as if their very power of sight had
been blighted by what he had read. His title, and
his paternal fortune, which he thought but an
instant before might be rendered unchallengeable by
a single movement of his hand, seemed now on the
verge of being lost for ever. His rapid recollection
failed not to remind him of what was less known to
the world, that his early and profuse expenditure
had greatly dilapidated his maternal fortune; and
that the estate of Nettlewood, which five minutes
ago he only coveted as a wealthy man desires
increase of his store, must now be acquired, if he
would avoid being a poor and embarrassed spendthrift.
To impede his possessing himself of this<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_224" id="vol_ii_Page_224">[Pg&nbsp;224]</a></span>
property, fate had restored to the scene the penitent
of the morning, who, as he had too much reason to
believe, was returned to this neighbourhood, to do
justice to Clara Mowbray, and who was not unlikely
to put the whole story of the marriage on its right
footing. She, however, might be got rid of; and
it might still be possible to hurry Miss Mowbray,
by working on her fears, or through the agency of
her brother, into a union with him while he still
preserved the title of Lord Etherington. This, therefore,
he resolved to secure, if effort or if intrigue
could carry the point; nor was it the least consideration,
that, should he succeed, he would obtain
over Tyrrel, his successful rival, such a triumph, as
would be sufficient to embitter the tranquillity of
his whole life.</p>

<p>In a few minutes, his rapid and contriving
invention had formed a plan for securing the sole
advantage which seemed to remain open for him;
and conscious that he had no time to lose, he
entered immediately upon the execution.</p>

<p>The bell summoned Solmes to his lordship's
apartment, when the Earl, as coolly as if he had
hoped to dupe his experienced valet by such an
assertion, said, &ldquo;You have brought me a packet
designed for some man at the Aultoun&mdash;let it be
sent to him&mdash;Stay,&mdash;I will re-seal it first.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He accordingly re-sealed the packet, containing
all the writings, excepting the letter of advice,
(which he had burnt,) and gave it to the valet, with
the caution, &ldquo;I wish you would not make such
blunders in future.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I beg your lordship's pardon&mdash;I will take better
care again&mdash;thought it was addressed to your
lordship.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_225" id="vol_ii_Page_225">[Pg&nbsp;225]</a></span></p>

<p>So answered Solmes, too knowing to give the least
look of intelligence, far less to remind the Earl
that his own directions had occasioned the mistake
of which he complained.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Solmes,&rdquo; continued the Earl, &ldquo;you need not
mention your blunder at the post-office; it would
only occasion tattle in this idle place&mdash;but be sure
that the gentleman has his letter.&mdash;And, Solmes,
I see Mr. Mowbray walk across&mdash;ask him to dine
with me to-day at five. I have a headache, and cannot
face the clamour of the savages who feed at the
public table.&mdash;And let me see&mdash;make my compliments
to Lady Penelope Penfeather&mdash;I will
certainly have the honour of waiting on her ladyship
this evening to tea, agreeably to her very
boring invitation received&mdash;write her a proper
card, and word it your own way. Bespeak dinner
for two, and see you have some of that batch of
Burgundy.&rdquo; The servant was retiring, when his
master added, &ldquo;Stay a moment&mdash;I have a more
important business than I have yet mentioned.&mdash;Solmes,
you have managed devilish ill about the
woman Irwin!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I, my lord?&rdquo; answered Solmes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, you, sir&mdash;did you not tell me she had gone
to the West Indies with a friend of yours, and did
not I give them a couple of hundred pounds for
passage-money?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, my lord,&rdquo; replied the valet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, but now it proves <i>no</i>, my lord,&rdquo; said Lord
Etherington; &ldquo;for she has found her way back to
this country in miserable plight&mdash;half-starved, and,
no doubt, willing to do or say any thing for a livelihood&mdash;How
has this happened?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Biddulph must have taken her cash, and turned<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_226" id="vol_ii_Page_226">[Pg&nbsp;226]</a></span>
her loose, my lord,&rdquo; answered Solmes, as if he had
been speaking of the most commonplace transaction
in the world; &ldquo;but I know the woman's nature
so well, and am so much master of her history,
that I can carry her off the country in twenty-four
hours, and place her where she will never think of
returning, provided your lordship can spare me so
long.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;About it directly&mdash;but I can tell you, that you
will find the woman in a very penitential humour,
and very ill in health to boot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sure of my game,&rdquo; answered Solmes;
&ldquo;with submission to your lordship, I think if death
and her good angel had hold of one of that woman's
arms, the devil and I could make a shift to lead her
away by the other.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Away and about it, then,&rdquo; said Etherington.
&ldquo;But, hark ye, Solmes, be kind to her, and see
all her wants relieved. I have done her mischief
enough&mdash;though nature and the devil had done half
the work to my hand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Solmes at length was permitted to withdraw to
execute his various commissions, with an assurance
that his services would not be wanted for the next
twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Soh!&rdquo; said the Earl, as his agent withdrew,
&ldquo;there is a spring put in motion, which, well oiled,
will move the whole machine&mdash;And here, in lucky
time, comes Harry Jekyl&mdash;I hear his whistle on
the stairs.&mdash;There is a silly lightness of heart about
that fellow, which I envy, while I despise it; but he
is welcome now, for I want him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jekyl entered accordingly, and broke out with
&ldquo;I am glad to see one of your fellows laying a cloth
for two in your parlour, Etherington&mdash;I was afraid<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_227" id="vol_ii_Page_227">[Pg&nbsp;227]</a></span>
you were going down among these confounded bores
again to-day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>You</i> are not to be one of the two, Hal,&rdquo; answered
Lord Etherington.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No?&mdash;then I may be a third, I hope, if not
second?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Neither first, second, nor third, Captain.&mdash;The
truth is, I want a t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te with Mr. Mowbray of
St. Ronan's,&rdquo; replied the Earl; &ldquo;and, besides, I
have to beg the very particular favour of you to go
again to that fellow Martigny. It is time that he
should produce his papers, if he has any&mdash;of which,
for one, I do not believe a word. He has had ample
time to hear from London; and I think I have
delayed long enough in an important matter upon
his bare assertion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot blame your impatience,&rdquo; said Jekyl,
&ldquo;and I will go on your errand instantly. As you
waited on my advice, I am bound to find an end
to your suspense.&mdash;At the same time, if the man is
not possessed of such papers as he spoke of, I must
own he is happy in a command of consummate
assurance, which might set up the whole roll of
attorneys.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will be soon able to judge of that,&rdquo; said
Lord Etherington; &ldquo;and now, off with you&mdash;Why
do you look at me so anxiously?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot tell&mdash;I have strange forebodings about
this t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te with Mowbray. You should spare
him, Etherington&mdash;he is not your match&mdash;wants
both judgment and temper.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell him so, Jekyl,&rdquo; answered the Earl, &ldquo;and
his proud Scotch stomach will be up in an instant,
and he will pay you with a shot for your pains.&mdash;Why,
he thinks himself cock of the walk, this<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_228" id="vol_ii_Page_228">[Pg&nbsp;228]</a></span>
strutting bantam, notwithstanding the lesson I gave
him before&mdash;And what do you think?&mdash;He has the
impudence to talk about my attentions to Lady
Binks as inconsistent with the prosecution of my
suit to his sister! Yes, Hal&mdash;this awkward Scotch
laird, that has scarce tact enough to make love to
a ewe-milker, or, at best, to some daggletailed
soubrette, has the assurance to start himself as my
rival!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then, good-night to St. Ronan's!&mdash;this will be
a fatal dinner to him.&mdash;Etherington, I know by that
laugh you are bent on mischief&mdash;I have a great
mind to give him a hint.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish you would,&rdquo; answered the Earl; &ldquo;it
would all turn to my account.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you defy me?&mdash;Well, if I meet him, I will
put him on his guard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The friends parted; and it was not long ere
Jekyl encountered Mowbray on one of the public
walks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You dine with Etherington to-day?&rdquo; said the
Captain&mdash;&ldquo;Forgive me, Mr. Mowbray, if I say one
single word&mdash;Beware.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of what should I beware, Captain Jekyl,&rdquo;
answered Mowbray, &ldquo;when I dine with a friend of
your own, and a man of honour?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly Lord Etherington is both, Mr. Mowbray;
but he loves play, and is too hard for most
people.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thank you for your hint, Captain Jekyl&mdash;I
am a raw Scotchman, it is true; but yet I know
a thing or two. Fair play is always presumed
amongst gentlemen; and that taken for granted,
I have the vanity to think I need no one's caution
on the subject, not even Captain Jekyl's, though<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_229" id="vol_ii_Page_229">[Pg&nbsp;229]</a></span>
his experience must needs be so much superior
to mine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In that case, sir,&rdquo; said Jekyl, bowing coldly,
&ldquo;I have no more to say, and I hope there is no
harm done.&mdash;Conceited coxcomb!&rdquo; he added, mentally,
as they parted, &ldquo;how truly did Etherington
judge of him, and what an ass was I to intermeddle!&mdash;I
hope Etherington will strip him of
every feather!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He pursued his walk in quest of Tyrrel, and
Mowbray proceeded to the apartments of the Earl,
in a temper of mind well suited to the purposes of
the latter, who judged of his disposition accurately
when he permitted Jekyl to give his well-meant
warning. To be supposed, by a man of acknowledged
fashion, so decidedly inferior to his antagonist&mdash;to
be considered as an object of compassion, and
made the subject of a good-boy warning, was gall
and bitterness to his proud spirit, which, the more
that he felt a conscious inferiority in the arts which
they all cultivated, struggled the more to preserve
the footing of at least apparent equality.</p>

<p>Since the first memorable party at piquet, Mowbray
had never hazarded his luck with Lord
Etherington, except for trifling stakes; but his conceit
led him to suppose that he now fully understood
his play, and, agreeably to the practice of those
who have habituated themselves to gambling, he
had every now and then felt a yearning to try for
his revenge. He wished also to be out of Lord
Etherington's debt, feeling galled under a sense of
pecuniary obligation, which hindered his speaking
his mind to him fully upon the subject of his flirtation
with Lady Binks, which he justly considered
as an insult to his family, considering the footing<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_230" id="vol_ii_Page_230">[Pg&nbsp;230]</a></span>
on which the Earl seemed desirous to stand with
Clara Mowbray. From these obligations a favourable
evening might free him, and Mowbray was,
in fact, indulging in a waking dream to this purpose,
when Jekyl interrupted him. His untimely
warning only excited a spirit of contradiction, and
a determination to show the adviser how little he
was qualified to judge of his talents; and in this
humour, his ruin, which was the consequence of
that afternoon, was far from seeming to be the
premeditated, or even the voluntary work of the
Earl of Etherington.</p>

<p>On the contrary, the victim himself was the first
to propose play&mdash;deep play&mdash;double stakes; while
Lord Etherington, on the other hand, often proposed
to diminish their game, or to break off entirely;
but it was always with an affectation of superiority
which only stimulated Mowbray to farther and
more desperate risks; and, at last, when Mowbray
became his debtor to an overwhelming amount, (his
circumstances considered,) the Earl threw down
the cards, and declared he should be too late for
Lady Penelope's tea-party, to which he was positively
engaged.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you not give me my revenge?&rdquo; said Mowbray,
taking up the cards, and shuffling them with
fierce anxiety.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not now, Mowbray; we have played too long
already&mdash;you have lost too much&mdash;more than perhaps
is convenient for you to pay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mowbray gnashed his teeth, in spite of his resolution
to maintain an exterior, at least, of firmness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can take your time, you know,&rdquo; said the
Earl; &ldquo;a note of hand will suit me as well as the
money.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_231" id="vol_ii_Page_231">[Pg&nbsp;231]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;No, by G&mdash;!&rdquo; answered Mowbray, &ldquo;I will not
be so taken in a second time&mdash;I had better have
sold myself to the devil than to your lordship&mdash;I
have never been my own man since.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;These are not very kind expressions, Mowbray,&rdquo;
said the Earl; &ldquo;you <i>would</i> play, and they
that will play must expect sometimes to lose&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And they who win will expect to be paid,&rdquo; said
Mowbray, breaking in. &ldquo;I know that as well as
you, my lord, and you shall be paid&mdash;I will pay
you&mdash;I will pay you, by G&mdash;! Do you make
any doubt that I will pay you, my lord?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You look as if you thought of paying me in
sharp coin,&rdquo; said Lord Etherington; &ldquo;and I think
that would scarce be consistent with the terms we
stand upon towards each other.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By my soul, my lord,&rdquo; said Mowbray, &ldquo;I cannot
tell what these terms are; and to be at my wit's
end at once, I should be glad to know. You set out
upon paying addresses to my sister, and with your
visits and opportunities at Shaws-Castle, I cannot
find the matter makes the least progress&mdash;it keeps
moving without advancing, like a child's rocking-horse.
Perhaps you think that you have curbed
me up so tightly, that I dare not stir in the matter;
but you will find it otherwise.&mdash;Your lordship may
keep a haram if you will, but my sister shall not
enter it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are angry, and therefore you are unjust,&rdquo;
said Etherington; &ldquo;you know well enough it is
your sister's fault that there is any delay. I am
most willing&mdash;most desirous&mdash;to call her Lady
Etherington&mdash;nothing but her unlucky prejudices
against me have retarded a union which I have so
many reasons for desiring.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_232" id="vol_ii_Page_232">[Pg&nbsp;232]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; replied Mowbray, &ldquo;that shall be my
business. I know no reason she can pretend to
decline a marriage so honourable to her house, and
which is approved of by me, that house's head.
That matter shall be arranged in twenty-four
hours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will do me the most sensible pleasure,&rdquo; said
Lord Etherington; &ldquo;you shall soon see how sincerely
I desire your alliance; and as for the trifle
you have lost&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is no trifle to me, my lord&mdash;it is my ruin&mdash;but
it shall be paid&mdash;and let me tell your lordship,
you may thank your good luck for it more than
your good play.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will say no more of it at present, if you
please,&rdquo; said Lord Etherington, &ldquo;to-morrow is a
new day; and if you will take my advice, you will
not be too harsh with your sister. A little firmness
is seldom amiss with young women, but
severity&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will pray your lordship to spare me your
advice on this subject. However valuable it may be
in other respects, I can, I take it, speak to my own
sister in my own way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Since you are so caustically-disposed, Mowbray,&rdquo;
answered the Earl, &ldquo;I presume you will not
honour her ladyship's tea-table to-night, though I
believe it will be the last of the season?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And why should you think so, my lord?&rdquo;
answered Mowbray, whose losses had rendered him
testy and contradictory upon every subject that
was started. &ldquo;Why should not I pay my respects
to Lady Penelope, or any other tabby of quality?
I have no title, indeed; but I suppose that my
family&rdquo;&mdash;<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_233" id="vol_ii_Page_233">[Pg&nbsp;233]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Entitles you to become a canon of Strasburgh<a name="vol_ii_FNanchor_D_16" id="vol_ii_FNanchor_D_16"></a><a href="#vol_ii_Footnote_D_16" class="fnanchor">[D]</a>
doubtless&mdash;But you do not seem in
a very Christian mood for taking orders. All I
meant to say was, that you and Lady Pen were
not used to be on such a good footing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, she sent me a card for her blow-out,&rdquo;
said Mowbray; &ldquo;and so I am resolved to go. When
I have been there half an hour, I will ride up to
Shaws-Castle, and you shall hear of my speed in
wooing for you to-morrow morning.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_234" id="vol_ii_Page_234">[Pg&nbsp;234]</a></span></p>

Cowper's <i>Task</i>.<br />
</p>


<p>The approach of the cold and rainy season had
now so far thinned the company at the Well, that,
in order to secure the necessary degree of crowd
upon her tea-nights, Lady Penelope was obliged to
employ some coaxing towards those whom she had
considered as much under par in society. Even the
Doctor and Mrs. Blower were graciously smiled
upon&mdash;for their marriage was now an arranged
affair; and the event was of a nature likely to
spread the reputation of the Spa among wealthy
widows, and medical gentlemen of more skill than
practice. So in they came, the Doctor smirking,
gallanting, and performing all the bustling parade of
settled and arranged courtship, with much of that
grace wherewith a turkey-cock goes through the
same ceremony. Old Touchwood had also attended
her ladyship's summons, chiefly, it may be supposed,
from his restless fidgety disposition, which seldom
suffered him to remain absent even from those
places of resort of which he usually professed his<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_235" id="vol_ii_Page_235">[Pg&nbsp;235]</a></span>
detestation. There was, besides, Mr. Winterblossom,
who, in his usual spirit of quiet epicurism
and self-indulgence, was, under the fire of a volley
of compliments to Lady Penelope, scheming to
secure for himself an early cup of tea. There was
Lady Binks also, with the wonted degree of sullenness
in her beautiful face, angry at her husband
as usual, and not disposed to be pleased with Lord
Etherington for being absent, when she desired to
excite Sir Bingo's jealousy. This she had discovered
to be the most effectual way of tormenting the
Baronet, and she rejoiced in it with the savage glee
of a hackney coachman, who has found a <i>raw</i>,
where he can make his poor jade feel the whip.
The rest of the company were also in attendance as
usual. MacTurk himself was present, notwithstanding
that he thought it an egregious waste of
hot water, to bestow it upon compounding any mixture
saving punch. He had of late associated
himself a good deal with the traveller; not that
they by any means resembled each other in temper
or opinions, but rather because there was that
degree of difference betwixt them which furnished
perpetual subject for dispute and discussion. They
were not long, on the present occasion, ere they
lighted on a fertile source of controversy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never tell me of your points of honour,&rdquo; said
Touchwood, raising his voice altogether above the
general tone of polite conversation&mdash;&ldquo;all humbug,
Captain MacTurk&mdash;mere hair-traps to springe
woodcocks&mdash;men of sense break through them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Upon my word, sir,&rdquo; said the Captain, &ldquo;and
myself is surprised to hear you&mdash;for, look you,
sir, every man's honour is the breath of his nostrils&mdash;Cot
tamn!&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_236" id="vol_ii_Page_236">[Pg&nbsp;236]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Then, let men breathe through their mouths,
and be d&mdash;d,&rdquo; returned the controversialist. &ldquo;I tell
you, sir, that, besides its being forbidden, both by
law and gospel, it's an idiotical and totally absurd
practice, that of duelling. An honest savage has
more sense than to practise it&mdash;he takes his bow
or his gun, as the thing may be, and shoots his
enemy from behind a bush. And a very good way;
for you see there can, in that case, be only one
man's death between them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Saul of my body, sir,&rdquo; said the Captain, &ldquo;gin
ye promulgate sic doctrines amang the good company,
it's my belief you will bring somebody to the
gallows.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank ye, Captain, with all my heart; but I
stir up no quarrels&mdash;I leave war to them that live
by it. I only say, that, except our old, stupid
ancestors in the north-west here, I know no country
so silly as to harbour this custom of duelling. It
is unknown in Africa, among the negroes&mdash;in
America.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don't tell me that,&rdquo; said the Captain; &ldquo;a
Yankee will fight with muskets and buck-shot,
rather than sit still with an affront. I should
know Jonathan, I think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Altogether unknown among the thousand tribes
of India.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'll be tamned, then!&rdquo; said Captain MacTurk.
&ldquo;Was I not in Tippoo's prison at Bangalore? and,
when the joyful day of our liberation came, did we
not solemnize it with fourteen little affairs, whereof
we had been laying the foundation in our house of
captivity, as holy writ has it, and never went farther
to settle them than the glacis of the fort? By my
soul, you would have thought there was a smart<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_237" id="vol_ii_Page_237">[Pg&nbsp;237]</a></span>
skirmish, the firing was so close; and did not I,
Captain MacTurk, fight three of them myself, without
moving my foot from the place I set it on?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And pray, sir, what might be the result of this
Christian mode of giving thanks for your deliverance?&rdquo;
demanded Mr. Touchwood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A small list of casualties, after all,&rdquo; said the
Captain; &ldquo;one killed on the spot, one died of his
wounds&mdash;two wounded severely&mdash;three ditto
slightly, and little Duncan Macphail reported missing.
We were out of practice, after such long
confinement. So you see how we manage matters
in India, my dear friend.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are to understand,&rdquo; replied Touchwood,
&ldquo;that I spoke only of the heathen natives, who,
heathen as they are, live in the light of their own
moral reason, and among whom ye shall therefore
see better examples of practical morality than
among such as yourselves; who, though calling
yourselves Christians, have no more knowledge of
the true acceptation and meaning of your religion,
than if you had left your Christianity at the Cape
of Good Hope, as they say of you, and forgot to
take it up when you come back again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Py Cot! and I can tell you, sir,&rdquo; said the Captain,
elevating at once his voice and his nostrils,
and snuffing the air with a truculent and indignant
visage, &ldquo;that I will not permit you or any man to
throw any such scandal on my character.&mdash;I thank
Cot, I can bring good witness that I am as good a
Christian as another, for a poor sinner, as the best
of us are; and I am ready to justify my religion
with my sword&mdash;Cot tamn!&mdash;Compare my own
self with a parcel of black heathen bodies and
natives, that were never in the inner side of a kirk<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_238" id="vol_ii_Page_238">[Pg&nbsp;238]</a></span>
whilst they lived, but go about worshipping stocks
and stones, and swinging themselves upon bamboos,
like peasts, as they are!&rdquo;</p>

<p>An indignant growling in his throat, which
sounded like the acquiescence of his inward man
in the indignant proposition which his external
organs thus expressed, concluded this haughty
speech, which, however, made not the least impression
on Touchwood, who cared as little for angry
tones and looks as he did for fine speeches. So
that it is likely a quarrel between the Christian
preceptor and the peacemaker might have occurred
for the amusement of the company, had not the
attention of both, but particularly that of Touchwood,
been diverted from the topic of debate by the
entrance of Lord Etherington and Mowbray.</p>

<p>The former was, as usual, all grace, smiles, and
gentleness. Yet, contrary to his wonted custom,
which usually was, after a few general compliments,
to attach himself particularly to Lady Binks, the
Earl, on the present occasion, avoided the side of
the room on which that beautiful but sullen idol
held her station, and attached himself exclusively
to Lady Penelope Penfeather, enduring, without
flinching, the strange variety of conceited <i>bavardage</i>,
which that lady's natural parts and acquired
information enabled her to pour forth with unparalleled
profusion.</p>

<p>An honest heathen, one of Plutarch's heroes, if I
mistake not,<a name="vol_ii_FNanchor_E_17" id="vol_ii_FNanchor_E_17"></a><a href="#vol_ii_Footnote_E_17" class="fnanchor">[E]</a> dreamed once upon a night, that the
figure of Proserpina, whom he had long worshipped,
visited his slumbers with an angry and vindictive
countenance, and menaced him with vengeance, in
resentment of his having neglected her altars, with
the usual fickleness of a polytheist, for those of some<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_239" id="vol_ii_Page_239">[Pg&nbsp;239]</a></span>
more fashionable divinity. Not that goddess of
the infernal regions herself could assume a more
haughty or more displeased countenance than that
with which Lady Binks looked from time to time
upon Lord Etherington, as if to warn him of the
consequence of this departure from the allegiance
which the young Earl had hitherto manifested
towards her, and which seemed now, she knew
not why, unless it were for the purpose of public
insult, to be transferred to her rival. Perilous as
her eye-glances were, and much as they menaced,
Lord Etherington felt at this moment the importance
of soothing Lady Penelope to silence on the
subject of the invalid's confession of that morning,
to be more pressing than that of appeasing the
indignation of Lady Binks. The former was a case
of the most urgent necessity&mdash;the latter, if he was
at all anxious on the subject, might, he perhaps
thought, be trusted to time. Had the ladies continued
on a tolerable footing together, he might
have endeavoured to conciliate both. But the bitterness
of their long-suppressed feud had greatly
increased, now that it was probable the end of the
season was to separate them, in all likelihood for
ever; so that Lady Penelope had no longer any
motive for countenancing Lady Binks, or the lady
of Sir Bingo for desiring Lady Penelope's countenance.
The wealth and lavish expense of the one
was no longer to render more illustrious the suit
of her right honourable friend, nor was the society
of Lady Penelope likely to be soon again useful or
necessary to Lady Binks. So that neither were any
longer desirous to suppress symptoms of the mutual
contempt and dislike which they had long nourished
for each other; and whoever should, in this decisive<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_240" id="vol_ii_Page_240">[Pg&nbsp;240]</a></span>
hour, take part with one, had little henceforward to
expect from her rival. What farther and more private
reasons Lady Binks might have to resent the
defection of Lord Etherington, have never come
with certainty to our knowledge; but it was said
there had been high words between them on the
floating report that his lordship's visits to Shaws-Castle
were dictated by the wish to find a bride
there.</p>

<p>Women's wits are said to be quick in spying the
surest means of avenging a real or supposed slight.
After biting her pretty lips, and revolving in her
mind the readiest means of vengeance, fate threw
in her way young Mowbray of St. Ronan's. She
looked at him, and endeavoured to fix his attention
with a nod and gracious smile, such as in an ordinary
mood would have instantly drawn him to her
side. On receiving in answer only a vacant glance
and a bow, she was led to observe him more
attentively, and was induced to believe, from his
wavering look, varying complexion, and unsteady
step, that he had been drinking unusually deep.
Still his eye was less that of an intoxicated than of
a disturbed and desperate man, one whose faculties
were engrossed by deep and turbid reflection, which
withdrew him from the passing scene.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you observe how ill Mr. Mowbray looks?&rdquo;
said she, in a loud whisper; &ldquo;I hope he has not
heard what Lady Penelope was just now saying of
his family?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Unless he hears it from you, my lady,&rdquo; answered
Mr. Touchwood, who, upon Mowbray's entrance, had
broken off his discourse with MacTurk, &ldquo;I think
there is little chance of his learning it from any
other person.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_241" id="vol_ii_Page_241">[Pg&nbsp;241]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo; said Mowbray, sharply,
addressing Chatterly and Winterblossom; but the
one shrunk nervously from the question, protesting,
he indeed had not been precisely attending to what
had been passing among the ladies, and Winterblossom
bowed out of the scrape with quiet and cautious
politeness&mdash;&ldquo;he really had not given particular
attention to what was passing&mdash;I was negotiating
with Mrs. Jones for an additional lump of sugar to
my coffee.&mdash;Egad, it was so difficult a piece of
diplomacy,&rdquo; he added, sinking his voice, &ldquo;that I
have an idea her ladyship calculates the West
India produce by grains and pennyweights.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The innuendo, if designed to make Mowbray smile,
was far from succeeding. He stepped forward, with
more than usual stiffness in his air, which was never
entirely free from self-consequence, and said to Lady
Binks, &ldquo;May I request to know of your ladyship
what particular respecting my family had the honour
to engage the attention of the company?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was only a listener, Mr. Mowbray,&rdquo; returned
Lady Binks, with evident enjoyment of the rising
indignation which she read in his countenance;
&ldquo;not being queen of the night, I am not at all
disposed to be answerable for the turn of the
conversation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mowbray, in no humour to bear jesting, yet
afraid to expose himself by farther enquiry in a
company so public, darted a fierce look at Lady
Penelope, then in close conversation with Lord
Etherington,&mdash;advanced a step or two towards
them,&mdash;then, as if checking himself, turned on his
heel, and left the room. A few minutes afterwards,
and when certain satirical nods and winks were circulating
among the assembly, a waiter slid a piece<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_242" id="vol_ii_Page_242">[Pg&nbsp;242]</a></span>
of paper into Mrs. Jones's hand, who, on looking at
the contents, seemed about to leave the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jones&mdash;Jones!&rdquo; exclaimed Lady Penelope, in
surprise and displeasure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only the key of the tea-caddie, your ladyship,&rdquo;
answered Jones; &ldquo;I will be back in an instant.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jones&mdash;Jones!&rdquo; again exclaimed her mistress,
&ldquo;here is enough&rdquo;&mdash;of tea, she would have said;
but Lord Etherington was so near her, that she was
ashamed to complete the sentence, and had only
hope in Jones's quickness of apprehension, and the
prospect that she would be unable to find the key
which she went in search of.</p>

<p>Jones, meanwhile, tripped off to a sort of housekeeper's
apartment, of which she was <i>locum tenens</i>
for the evening, for the more ready supply of whatever
might be wanted on Lady Penelope's night,
as it was called. Here she found Mr. Mowbray of
St. Ronan's, whom she instantly began to assail
with, &ldquo;La! now, Mr. Mowbray, you are such another
gentleman!&mdash;I am sure you will make me lose my
place&mdash;I'll swear you will&mdash;what can you have to
say, that you could not as well put off for an
hour?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want to know, Jones,&rdquo; answered Mowbray, in
a different tone, perhaps, from what the damsel
expected, &ldquo;what your lady was just now saying
about my family.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pshaw!&mdash;was that all?&rdquo; answered Mrs. Jones.
&ldquo;What should she be saying?&mdash;nonsense&mdash;Who
minds what she says?&mdash;I am sure I never do, for
one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, but, my dear Jones,&rdquo; said Mowbray, &ldquo;I
insist upon knowing&mdash;I must know, and I <i>will</i>
know.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_243" id="vol_ii_Page_243">[Pg&nbsp;243]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;La! Mr. Mowbray, why should I make mischief?&mdash;As
I live, I hear some one coming! and if you
were found speaking with me here&mdash;indeed, indeed,
some one is coming!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The devil may come, if he will!&rdquo; said Mowbray,
&ldquo;but we do not part, pretty mistress, till you tell
me what I wish to know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lord, sir, you frighten me!&rdquo; answered Jones;
&ldquo;but all the room heard it as well as I&mdash;it was
about Miss Mowbray&mdash;and that my lady would be
shy of her company hereafter&mdash;for that she was&mdash;she
was&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For that my sister was <i>what</i>?&rdquo; said Mowbray,
fiercely, seizing her arm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lord, sir, you terrify me!&rdquo; said Jones, beginning
to cry; &ldquo;at any rate, it was not I that said it&mdash;it
was Lady Penelope.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what was it the old, adder-tongued madwoman
dared to say of Clara Mowbray?&mdash;Speak
out plainly, and directly, or, by Heaven, I'll make
you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold, sir&mdash;hold, for God's sake!&mdash;you will
break my arm,&rdquo; answered the terrified handmaiden.
&ldquo;I am sure I know no harm of Miss Mowbray;
only, my lady spoke as if she was no better than
she ought to be.&mdash;Lord, sir, there is some one listening
at the door!&rdquo;&mdash;and making a spring out of
his grasp, she hastened back to the room in which
the company were assembled.</p>

<p>Mowbray stood petrified at the news he had
heard, ignorant alike what could be the motive for
a calumny so atrocious, and uncertain what he were
best do to put a stop to the scandal. To his farther
confusion, he was presently convinced of the truth
of Mrs. Jones's belief that they had been watched,<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_244" id="vol_ii_Page_244">[Pg&nbsp;244]</a></span>
for, as he went to the door of the apartment, he was
met by Mr. Touchwood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What has brought you here, sir?&rdquo; said Mowbray,
sternly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hoitie toitie,&rdquo; answered the traveller, &ldquo;why,
how came <i>you</i> here, if you go to that, squire?&mdash;Egad,
Lady Penelope is trembling for her souchong,
so I just took a step here to save her
ladyship the trouble of looking after Mrs. Jones
in person, which, I think, might have been a worse
interruption than mine, Mr. Mowbray.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pshaw, sir, you talk nonsense,&rdquo; said Mowbray;
&ldquo;the tea-room is so infernally hot, that I had sat
down here a moment to draw breath, when the
young woman came in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you are going to run away, now the old
gentleman is come in?&rdquo; said Touchwood&mdash;&ldquo;Come,
sir, I am more your friend than you may think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir, you are intrusive&mdash;I want nothing that
you can give me,&rdquo; said Mowbray.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is a mistake,&rdquo; answered the senior; &ldquo;for
I can supply you with what most young men want&mdash;money
and wisdom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will do well to keep both till they are
wanted,&rdquo; said Mowbray.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, so I would, squire, only that I have taken
something of a fancy for your family; and they are
supposed to have wanted cash and good counsel for
two generations, if not for three.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said Mowbray, angrily, &ldquo;you are too old
either to play the buffoon, or to get buffoon's
payment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Which is like monkey's allowance, I suppose,&rdquo;
said the traveller, &ldquo;more kicks than halfpence.&mdash;Well&mdash;at
least I am not young enough to quarrel<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_245" id="vol_ii_Page_245">[Pg&nbsp;245]</a></span>
with boys for bullying. I'll convince you, however,
Mr. Mowbray, that I know some more of your affairs
than what you give me credit for.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It may be,&rdquo; answered Mowbray, &ldquo;but you will
oblige me more by minding your own.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very like; meantime, your losses to-night to
my Lord Etherington are no trifle, and no secret
neither.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Touchwood, I desire to know where you
had your information?&rdquo; said Mowbray.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A matter of very little consequence compared
to its truth or falsehood, Mr. Mowbray,&rdquo; answered
the old gentleman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But of the last importance to me, sir,&rdquo; said
Mowbray. &ldquo;In a word, had you such information
by or through means of Lord Etherington?&mdash;Answer
me this single question, and then I shall
know better what to think on the subject.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Upon my honour,&rdquo; said Touchwood, &ldquo;I neither
had my information from Lord Etherington directly
nor indirectly. I say thus much to give you satisfaction,
and I now expect you will hear me with
patience.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Forgive me, sir,&rdquo; interrupted Mowbray, &ldquo;one
farther question. I understand something was said
in disparagement of my sister just as I entered the
tea-room?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hem&mdash;hem&mdash;hem!&rdquo; said Touchwood, hesitating.
&ldquo;I am sorry your ears have served you so
well&mdash;something there <i>was</i> said lightly, something
that can be easily explained, I dare say;&mdash;And now,
Mr. Mowbray, let me speak a few serious words
with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now, Mr. Touchwood, we have no more to
say to each other&mdash;good evening to you.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_246" id="vol_ii_Page_246">[Pg&nbsp;246]</a></span></p>

<p>He brushed past the old man, who in vain
endeavoured to stop him, and, hurrying to the
stable, demanded his horse. It was ready saddled,
and waited his orders; but even the short time that
was necessary to bring it to the door of the stable
was exasperating to Mowbray's impatience. Not
less exasperating was the constant interceding voice
of Touchwood, who, in tones alternately plaintive
and snappish, kept on a string of expostulations.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Mowbray, only five words with you&mdash;Mr.
Mowbray, you will repent this&mdash;Is this a night to
ride in, Mr. Mowbray?&mdash;My stars, sir, if you
would but have five minutes' patience!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Curses, not loud but deep, muttered in the throat
of the impatient laird, were the only reply, until
his horse was brought out, when, staying no farther
question, he sprung into the saddle. The poor horse
paid for the delay, which could not be laid to his
charge. Mowbray struck him hard with his spurs
so soon as he was in his seat&mdash;the noble animal
reared, bolted, and sprung forward like a deer, over
stock and stone, the nearest road&mdash;and we are
aware it was a rough one&mdash;to Shaws-Castle. There
is a sort of instinct by which horses perceive the
humour of their riders, and are furious and impetuous,
or dull and sluggish, as if to correspond with
it; and Mowbray's gallant steed seemed on this
occasion to feel all the stings of his master's internal
ferment, although not again urged with the spur.
The ostler stood listening to the clash of the hoofs,
succeeding each other in thick and close gallop,
until they died away in the distant woodland.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If St. Ronan's reach home this night, with his
neck unbroken,&rdquo; muttered the fellow, &ldquo;the devil
must have it in keeping.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_247" id="vol_ii_Page_247">[Pg&nbsp;247]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Mercy on us!&rdquo; said the traveller, &ldquo;he rides
like a Bedouin Arab! but in the desert there are
neither trees to cross the road, nor cleughs, nor linns,
nor floods, nor fords. Well, I must set to work
myself, or this gear will get worse than even I can
mend.&mdash;Here you, ostler, let me have your best
pair of horses instantly to Shaws-Castle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To Shaws-Castle, sir?&rdquo; said the man, with some
surprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;do you not know such a place?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In troth, sir, sae few company go there, except
on the great ball day, that we have had time to forget
the road to it&mdash;but St. Ronan's was here even
now, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, what of that?&mdash;he has ridden on to get
supper ready&mdash;so, turn out without loss of time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At your pleasure, sir,&rdquo; said the fellow, and
called to the postilion accordingly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_248" id="vol_ii_Page_248">[Pg&nbsp;248]</a></span></p>

<p>Well was it that night for Mowbray, that he
had always piqued himself on his horses, and that
the animal on which he was then mounted was as
sure-footed and sagacious as he was mettled and
fiery. For those who observed next day the print
of the hoofs on the broken and rugged track through
which the creature had been driven at full speed by
his furious master, might easily see, that in more
than a dozen of places the horse and rider had been
within a few inches of destruction. One bough
of a gnarled and stunted oak-tree, which stretched
across the road, seemed in particular to have opposed
an almost fatal barrier to the horseman's career. In
striking his head against this impediment, the force
of the blow had been broken in some measure by a
high-crowned hat, yet the violence of the shock
was sufficient to shiver the branch to pieces. Fortunately,
it was already decayed; but, even in that
state, it was subject of astonishment to every one<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_249" id="vol_ii_Page_249">[Pg&nbsp;249]</a></span>
that no fatal damage had been sustained in so
formidable an encounter. Mowbray himself was
unconscious of the accident.</p>

<p>Scarcely aware that he had been riding at an
unusual rate, scarce sensible that he had ridden
faster perhaps than ever he followed the hounds,
Mowbray alighted at his stable door, and flung the
bridle to his groom, who held up his hands in astonishment
when he beheld the condition of the favourite
horse; but, concluding that his master must be
intoxicated, he prudently forbore to make any
observations.</p>

<p>No sooner did the unfortunate traveller suspend
that rapid motion by which he seemed to wish to
annihilate, as far as possible, time and space, in
order to reach the place he had now attained, than it
seemed to him as if he would have given the world
that seas and deserts had lain between him and
the house of his fathers, as well as that only sister
with whom he was now about to have a decisive
interview.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But the place and the hour are arrived,&rdquo; he
said, biting his lip with anguish; &ldquo;this explanation
must be decisive; and whatever evils may
attend it, suspense must be ended now, at once and
for ever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He entered the Castle, and took the light from
the old domestic, who, hearing the clatter of his
horse's feet, had opened the door to receive him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is my sister in her parlour?&rdquo; he asked, but in
so hollow a voice, that the old man only answered
the question by another, &ldquo;Was his honour well?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quite well, Patrick&mdash;never better in my life,&rdquo;
said Mowbray; and turning his back on the old
man, as if to prevent his observing whether his<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_250" id="vol_ii_Page_250">[Pg&nbsp;250]</a></span>
countenance and his words corresponded, he pursued
his way to his sister's apartment. The sound
of his step upon the passage roused Clara from a
reverie, perhaps a sad one; and she had trimmed
her lamp, and stirred her fire, so slow did he walk,
before he at length entered her apartment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are a good boy, brother,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;to
come thus early home; and I have some good news
for your reward. The groom has fetched back
Trimmer&mdash;He was lying by the dead hare, and he
had chased him as far as Drumlyford&mdash;the shepherd
had carried him to the shieling, till some one
should claim him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would he had hanged him, with all my heart!&rdquo;
said Mowbray.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How!&mdash;hang Trimmer?&mdash;your favourite Trimmer,
that has beat the whole country?&mdash;and it was
only this morning you were half-crying because he
was amissing, and like to murder man and mother's
son?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The better I like any living thing,&rdquo; answered
Mowbray, &ldquo;the more reason I have for wishing it
dead and at rest; for neither I, nor any thing that
I love, will ever be happy more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You cannot frighten me, John, with these
flights,&rdquo; answered Clara, trembling, although she
endeavoured to look unconcerned&mdash;&ldquo;You have used
me to them too often.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is well for you then; you will be ruined without
the shock of surprise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So much the better&mdash;We have been,&rdquo; said Clara,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;&lsquo;So constantly in poortith's sight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The thoughts on't gie us little fright.&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>So say I with honest Robert Burns.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_251" id="vol_ii_Page_251">[Pg&nbsp;251]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;D&mdash;n Barns and his trash!&rdquo; said Mowbray,
with the impatience of a man determined to be angry
with every thing but himself, who was the real
source of the evil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And why damn poor Burns?&rdquo; said Clara, composedly;
&ldquo;it is not his fault if you have not risen a
winner, for that, I suppose, is the cause of all this
uproar.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would it not make any one lose patience,&rdquo; said
Mowbray, &ldquo;to hear her quoting the rhapsodies of
a hobnail'd peasant, when a man is speaking of the
downfall of an ancient house! Your ploughman, I
suppose, becoming one degree poorer than he was
born to be, would only go without his dinner, or
without his usual potation of ale. His comrades
would cry &lsquo;poor fellow!&rsquo; and let him eat out of their
kit, and drink out of their bicker without scruple,
till his own was full again. But the poor gentleman&mdash;the
downfallen man of rank&mdash;the degraded
man of birth&mdash;the disabled and disarmed man of
power!&mdash;it is he that is to be pitied, who loses not
merely drink and dinner, but honour, situation,
credit, character, and name itself!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are declaiming in this manner in order
to terrify me,&rdquo; said Clara: &ldquo;but, friend John, I
know you and your ways, and I have made up my
mind upon all contingencies that can take place.
I will tell you more&mdash;I have stood on this tottering
pinnacle of rank and fashion, if our situation
can be termed such, till my head is dizzy with the
instability of my eminence; and I feel that strange
desire of tossing myself down, which the devil is
said to put into folk's heads when they stand on
the top of steeples&mdash;at least, I had rather the
plunge were over.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_252" id="vol_ii_Page_252">[Pg&nbsp;252]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Be satisfied, then; if that will satisfy you&mdash;the
plunge <i>is</i> over, and we are&mdash;what they used to call
it in Scotland&mdash;gentle beggars&mdash;creatures to whom
our second, and third, and fourth, and fifth cousins
may, if they please, give a place at the side-table,
and a seat in the carriage with the lady's maid, if
driving backwards will not make us sick.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They may give it to those who will take it,&rdquo;
said Clara; &ldquo;but I am determined to eat bread of
my own buying&mdash;I can do twenty things, and I am
sure some one or other of them will bring me all
the little money I will need. I have been trying,
John, for several months, how little I can live upon,
and you would laugh if you heard how low I have
brought the account.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is a difference, Clara, between fanciful
experiments and real poverty&mdash;the one is a masquerade,
which we can end when we please, the
other is wretchedness for life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Methinks, brother,&rdquo; replied Miss Mowbray,
&ldquo;it would be better for you to set me an example
how to carry my good resolutions into effect, than to
ridicule them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, what would you have me do?&rdquo; said he,
fiercely&mdash;&ldquo;turn postilion, or rough-rider, or whipper-in?&mdash;I
don't know any thing else that my
education, as I have used it, has fitted me for&mdash;and
then some of my old acquaintances would, I
dare say, give me a crown to drink now and then
for old acquaintance' sake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is not the way, John, that men of sense
think or speak of serious misfortunes,&rdquo; answered his
sister; &ldquo;and I do not believe that this is so serious
as it is your pleasure to make it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Believe the very worst you can think,&rdquo; replied<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_253" id="vol_ii_Page_253">[Pg&nbsp;253]</a></span>
he, &ldquo;and you will not believe bad enough!&mdash;You
have neither a guinea, nor a house, nor a friend;&mdash;pass
but a day, and it is a chance that you will not
have a brother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear John, you have drunk hard&mdash;rode
hard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;such tidings deserved to be carried express,
especially to a young lady who receives them so
well,&rdquo; answered Mowbray, bitterly. &ldquo;I suppose,
now, it will make no impression, if I were to tell
you that you have it in your power to stop all this
ruin?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By consummating my own, I suppose?&mdash;Brother,
I said you could not make me tremble, but you
have found a way to do it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What, you expect I am again to urge you with
Lord Etherington's courtship?&mdash;That <i>might</i> have
saved all, indeed&mdash;But that day of grace is over.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am glad of it, with all my spirit,&rdquo; said Clara;
&ldquo;may it take with it all that we can quarrel about!&mdash;But
till this instant I thought it was for this
very point that this long voyage was bound, and
that you were endeavouring to persuade me of the
reality of the danger of the storm, in order to reconcile
me to the harbour.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are mad, I think, in earnest,&rdquo; said Mowbray;
&ldquo;can you really be so absurd as to rejoice
that you have no way left to relieve yourself and me
from ruin, want, and shame?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;From shame, brother?&rdquo; said Clara. &ldquo;No shame
in honest poverty, I hope.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is according as folks have used their prosperity,
Clara.&mdash;I must speak to the point.&mdash;There
are strange reports going below&mdash;By Heaven! they
are enough to disturb the ashes of the dead! Were<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_254" id="vol_ii_Page_254">[Pg&nbsp;254]</a></span>
I to mention them, I should expect our poor mother
to enter the room&mdash;Clara Mowbray, can you guess
what I mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was with the utmost exertion, yet in a faltering
voice, that she was able, after an ineffectual
effort, to utter the monosyllable, &ldquo;<i>No!</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By Heaven! I am ashamed&mdash;I am even <i>afraid</i>
to express my own meaning!&mdash;Clara, what is there
which makes you so obstinately reject every proposal
of marriage?&mdash;Is it that you feel yourself
unworthy to be the wife of an honest man?&mdash;Speak
out!&mdash;Evil Fame has been busy with your reputation&mdash;speak
out!&mdash;Give me the right to cram their
lies down the throats of the inventors, and when I
go among them to-morrow, I shall know how to
treat those who cast reflections on you! The fortunes
of our house are ruined, but no tongue shall
slander its honour.&mdash;Speak&mdash;speak, wretched girl!
why are you silent?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stay at home, brother!&rdquo; said Clara; &ldquo;stay at
home, if you regard our house's honour&mdash;murder
cannot mend misery&mdash;Stay at home, and let them
talk of me as they will,&mdash;they can scarcely say
worse of me than I deserve!&rdquo;<a name="vol_ii_FNanchor_F_18" id="vol_ii_FNanchor_F_18"></a><a href="#vol_ii_Footnote_F_18" class="fnanchor">[F]</a></p>

<p>The passions of Mowbray, at all times ungovernably
strong, were at present inflamed by wine, by his
rapid journey, and the previously disturbed state of
his mind. He set his teeth, clenched his hands,
looked on the ground, as one that forms some horrid
resolution, and muttered almost unintelligibly, &ldquo;It
were charity to kill her!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! no&mdash;no&mdash;no!&rdquo; exclaimed the terrified
girl, throwing herself at his feet; &ldquo;Do not kill me,
brother! I have wished for death&mdash;thought of
death&mdash;prayed for death&mdash;but, oh! it is frightful<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_255" id="vol_ii_Page_255">[Pg&nbsp;255]</a></span>
to think that he is near&mdash;Oh! not a bloody death,
brother, nor by your hand!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She held him close by the knees as she spoke, and
expressed, in her looks and accents, the utmost
terror. It was not, indeed, without reason; for the
extreme solitude of the place, the violent and
inflamed passions of her brother, and the desperate
circumstances to which he had reduced himself,
seemed all to concur to render some horrid act of
violence not an improbable termination of this
strange interview.</p>

<p>Mowbray folded his arms, without unclenching his
hands, or raising his head, while his sister continued
on the floor, clasping him round the knees with all
her strength, and begging piteously for her life and
for mercy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fool!&rdquo; he said, at last, &ldquo;let me go!&mdash;Who
cares for thy worthless life?&mdash;who cares if thou
live or die? Live, if thou canst&mdash;and be the hate
and scorn of every one else, as much as thou art
mine!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He grasped her by the shoulder, with one hand
pushed her from him, and, as she arose from the
floor, and again pressed to throw her arms around
his neck, he repulsed her with his arm and hand,
with a push&mdash;or blow&mdash;it might be termed either
one or the other,&mdash;violent enough, in her weak
state, to have again extended her on the ground,
had not a chair received her as she fell. He looked
at her with ferocity, grappled a moment in his
pocket; then ran to the window, and throwing the
sash violently up, thrust himself as far as he could
without falling, into the open air. Terrified, and
yet her feelings of his unkindness predominating
even above her fears, Clara continued to exclaim.<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_256" id="vol_ii_Page_256">[Pg&nbsp;256]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, brother, say you did not mean this!&mdash;Oh,
say you did not mean to strike me!&mdash;Oh, whatever
I have deserved, be not you the executioner!&mdash;It
is not manly&mdash;it is not natural&mdash;there are but two
of us in the world!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He returned no answer; and, observing that he
continued to stretch himself from the window,
which was in the second story of the building, and
overlooked the court, a new cause of apprehension
mingled, in some measure, with her personal fears.
Timidly, and with streaming eyes and uplifted
hands, she approached her angry brother, and, fearfully,
yet firmly, seized the skirt of his coat, as if
anxious to preserve him from the effects of that
despair, which so lately seemed turned against her,
and now against himself.</p>

<p>He felt the pressure of her hold, and drawing
himself angrily back, asked her sternly what she
wanted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; she said, quitting her hold of his
coat; &ldquo;but what&mdash;what did he look after so
anxiously?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;After the devil!&rdquo; he answered, fiercely; then
drawing in his head, and taking her hand, &ldquo;By
my soul, Clara&mdash;it is true, if ever there was truth
in such a tale!&mdash;He stood by me just now, and
urged me to murder thee!&mdash;What else could have
put my hunting-knife into my thought?&mdash;Ay, by
God, and into my very hand&mdash;at such a moment?&mdash;Yonder
I could almost fancy I see him fly, the
wood, and the rock, and the water, gleaming back
the dark-red furnace-light, that is shed on them
by his dragon wings! By my soul, I can hardly
suppose it fancy&mdash;I can hardly think but that I
was under the influence of an evil spirit&mdash;under<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_257" id="vol_ii_Page_257">[Pg&nbsp;257]</a></span>
an act of fiendish possession! But gone as he is,
gone let him be&mdash;and thou, too ready implement
of evil, be thou gone after him!&rdquo; He drew from
his pocket his right hand, which had all this time
held his hunting-knife, and threw the implement
into the court-yard as he spoke, then, with a
sad quietness, and solemnity of manner, shut the
window, and led his sister by the hand to her usual
seat, which her tottering steps scarce enabled
her to reach. &ldquo;Clara,&rdquo; he said, after a pause of
mournful silence, &ldquo;we must think what is to be
done, without passion or violence&mdash;there may be
something for us in the dice yet, if we do not throw
away our game. A blot is never a blot till it is hit&mdash;dishonour
concealed, is not dishonour in some
respects.&mdash;Dost thou attend to me, wretched girl?&rdquo;
he said, suddenly and sternly raising his voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, brother&mdash;yes, indeed, brother!&rdquo; she hastily
replied, terrified even by delay again to awaken his
ferocious and ungovernable temper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thus it must be, then,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You must
marry this Etherington&mdash;there is no help for it,
Clara&mdash;You cannot complain of what your own
vice and folly have rendered inevitable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, brother!&rdquo;&mdash;said the trembling girl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be silent. I know all that you would say.
You love him not, you would say. I love him not,
no more than you. Nay, what is more, he loves
you not; if he did, I might scruple to give you to
him, you being such as you have owned yourself.
But you shall wed him out of hate, Clara&mdash;or for
the interest of your family&mdash;or for what reason
you will&mdash;But wed him you shall and must.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Brother&mdash;dearest brother&mdash;one single word!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not of refusal or expostulation&mdash;that time is<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_258" id="vol_ii_Page_258">[Pg&nbsp;258]</a></span>
gone by,&rdquo; said her stern censurer. &ldquo;When I
believed thee what I thought thee this morning, I
might advise you, but I could not compel. But,
since the honour of our family has been disgraced
by your means, it is but just, that, if possible, its
disgrace should be hidden; and it shall,&mdash;ay, if
selling you for a slave would tend to conceal it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You do worse&mdash;you do worse by me! A slave
in an open market may be bought by a kind master&mdash;you
do not give me that chance&mdash;you wed me
to one who&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fear him not, nor the worst that he can do,
Clara,&rdquo; said her brother. &ldquo;I know on what terms
he marries; and being once more your brother, as
your obedience in this matter will make me, he had
better tear his flesh from his bones with his own
teeth, than do thee any displeasure! By Heaven,
I hate him so much&mdash;for he has outreached me
every way&mdash;that methinks it is some consolation
that he will not receive in thee the excellent creature
I thought thee!&mdash;Fallen as thou art, thou art still
too good for him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Encouraged by the more gentle and almost affectionate
tone in which her brother spoke, Clara could
not help saying, although almost in a whisper, &ldquo;I
trust it will not be so&mdash;I trust he will consider his
own condition, honour, and happiness, better than
to share it with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let him utter such a scruple if he dares,&rdquo; said
Mowbray&mdash;&ldquo;But he dares not hesitate&mdash;he knows
that the instant he recedes from addressing you, he
signs his own death-warrant or mine, or perhaps
that of both; and his views, too, are of a kind that
will not be relinquished on a point of scrupulous
delicacy merely. Therefore, Clara, nourish no such<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_259" id="vol_ii_Page_259">[Pg&nbsp;259]</a></span>
thought in your heart as that there is the least
possibility of your escaping this marriage! The
match is booked&mdash;Swear you will not hesitate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will not,&rdquo; she said, almost breathlessly, terrified
lest he was about to start once more into the
fit of unbridled fury which had before seized on
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do not even whisper or hint an objection, but
submit to your fate, for it is inevitable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will&mdash;submit&rdquo;&mdash;answered Clara, in the same
trembling accent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;will spare you&mdash;at least at
present&mdash;and it may be for ever&mdash;all enquiry into
the guilt which you have confessed. Rumours there
were of misconduct, which reached my ears even in
England; but who could have believed them that
looked on you daily, and witnessed your late course
of life?&mdash;On this subject I will be at present silent&mdash;perhaps
may not again touch on it&mdash;that is, if
you do nothing to thwart my pleasure, or to avoid
the fate which circumstances render unavoidable.&mdash;And
now it is late&mdash;retire, Clara, to your bed&mdash;think
on what I have said as what necessity has
determined, and not my selfish pleasure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He held out his hand, and she placed, but not
without reluctant terror, her trembling palm in his.
In this manner, and with a sort of mournful solemnity,
as if they had been in attendance upon a
funeral, he handed his sister through a gallery hung
with old family pictures, at the end of which was
Clara's bedchamber. The moon, which at this
moment looked out through a huge volume of mustering
clouds that had long been boding storm, fell
on the two last descendants of that ancient family,
as they glided hand in hand, more like the ghosts of<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_260" id="vol_ii_Page_260">[Pg&nbsp;260]</a></span>
the deceased than like living persons, through the
hall and amongst the portraits of their forefathers.
The same thoughts were in the breast of both, but
neither attempted to say, while they cast a flitting
glance on the pallid and decayed representations,
&ldquo;How little did these anticipate this catastrophe
of their house!&rdquo; At the door of the bedroom Mowbray
quitted his sister's hand, and said, &ldquo;Clara, you
should to-night thank God, that saved you from a
great danger, and me from a deadly sin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; she answered&mdash;&ldquo;I will.&rdquo; And, as if
her terror had been anew excited by this allusion
to what had passed, she bid her brother hastily
good-night, and was no sooner within her apartment,
than he heard her turn the key in the lock,
and draw two bolts besides.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I understand you, Clara,&rdquo; muttered Mowbray
between his teeth, as he heard one bar drawn after
another. &ldquo;But if you could earth yourself under
Ben Nevis, you could not escape what fate has
destined for you.&mdash;Yes!&rdquo; he said to himself, as he
walked with slow and moody pace through the
moonlight gallery, uncertain whether to return to
the parlour, or to retire to his solitary chamber,
when his attention was roused by a noise in the
court-yard.</p>

<p>The night was not indeed very far advanced, but
it had been so long since Shaws-Castle received a
guest, that had Mowbray not heard the rolling of
wheels in the court-yard, he might have thought
rather of housebreakers than of visitors. But, as
the sound of a carriage and horses was distinctly
heard, it instantly occurred to him, that the guest
must be Lord Etherington, come, even at this late
hour, to speak with him on the reports which were<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_261" id="vol_ii_Page_261">[Pg&nbsp;261]</a></span>
current to his sister's prejudice, and perhaps to
declare his addresses to her were at an end. Eager
to know the worst, and to bring matters to a decision,
he re-entered the apartment he had just left,
where the lights were still burning, and, calling
loudly to Patrick, whom he heard in communing
with the postilion, commanded him to show the
visitor to Miss Mowbray's parlour. It was not the
light step of the young nobleman which came
tramping, or rather stamping, through the long passage,
and up the two or three steps at the end of it.
Neither was it Lord Etherington's graceful figure
which was seen when the door opened, but the stout
square substance of Mr. Peregrine Touchwood.<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_262" id="vol_ii_Page_262">[Pg&nbsp;262]</a></span></p>

<i>Deserted Village.</i><br />
</p>


<p>Starting at the unexpected and undesired apparition
which presented itself, in the manner described
at the end of the last chapter, Mowbray yet
felt, at the same time, a kind of relief, that his
meeting with Lord Etherington, painfully decisive
as that meeting must be, was for a time suspended.
So it was with a mixture of peevishness and internal
satisfaction, that he demanded what had procured
him the honour of a visit from Mr. Touchwood at
this late hour.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Necessity, that makes the old wife trot,&rdquo; replied
Touchwood; &ldquo;no choice of mine, I assure you&mdash;Gad,
Mr. Mowbray, I would rather have crossed
Saint Gothard, than run the risk I have done
to-night, rumbling through your breakneck roads
in that d&mdash;&mdash;d old wheelbarrow.&mdash;On my word,
I believe I must be troublesome to your butler
for a draught of something&mdash;I am as thirsty
as a coal-heaver that is working by the piece.
You have porter, I suppose, or good old Scotch
two-penny?&rdquo;</p>

<p>With a secret execration on his visitor's effrontery,
Mr. Mowbray ordered the servant to put down<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_263" id="vol_ii_Page_263">[Pg&nbsp;263]</a></span>
wine and water, of which Touchwood mixed a gobletful,
and drank it off.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are a small family,&rdquo; said his entertainer;
&ldquo;and I am seldom at home&mdash;still more seldom
receive guests, when I chance to be here&mdash;I am
sorry I have no malt liquor, if you prefer it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Prefer it?&rdquo; said Touchwood, compounding,
however, another glass of sherry and water, and
adding a large piece of sugar, to correct the hoarseness
which, he observed, his night journey might
bring on,&mdash;&ldquo;to be sure I prefer it, and so does
every body, except Frenchmen and dandies.&mdash;No
offence, Mr. Mowbray, but you should order a hogshead
from Meux&mdash;the brown-stout, wired down
for exportation to the colonies, keeps for any length
of time, and in every climate&mdash;I have drank it
where it must have cost a guinea a quart, if interest
had been counted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When I <i>expect</i> the honour of a visit from you,
Mr. Touchwood, I will endeavour to be better
provided,&rdquo; answered Mowbray; &ldquo;at present your
arrival has been without notice, and I would be glad
to know if it has any particular object.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is what I call coming to the point,&rdquo; said
Mr. Touchwood, thrusting out his stout legs,
accoutred as they were with the ancient defences,
called boot-hose, so as to rest his heels upon the
fender. &ldquo;Upon my life, the fire turns the best
flower in the garden at this season of the year&mdash;I'll
take the freedom to throw on a log.&mdash;Is it not
a strange thing, by the by, that one never sees a
fagot in Scotland? You have much small wood,
Mr. Mowbray, I wonder you do not get some fellow
from the midland counties, to teach your people
how to make a fagot.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_264" id="vol_ii_Page_264">[Pg&nbsp;264]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you come all the way to Shaws-Castle,&rdquo;
asked Mowbray, rather testily, &ldquo;to instruct me in
the mystery of fagot-making?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not exactly&mdash;not exactly,&rdquo; answered the
undaunted Touchwood; &ldquo;but there is a right and a
wrong way in every thing&mdash;a word by the way, on
any useful subject, can never fall amiss.&mdash;As for
my immediate and more pressing business, I can
assure you, that it is of a nature sufficiently urgent,
since it brings me to a house in which I am much
surprised to find myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The surprise is mutual, sir,&rdquo; said Mowbray,
gravely, observing that his guest made a pause; &ldquo;it
is full time you should explain it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; replied Touchwood; &ldquo;I must first
ask you whether you have never heard of a certain
old gentleman, called Scrogie, who took it into
what he called his head, poor man, to be ashamed
of the name he bore, though owned by many honest
and respectable men, and chose to join it to your
surname of Mowbray, as having a more chivalrous
Norman sounding, and, in a word, a gentlemanlike
twang with it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have heard of such a person, though only
lately,&rdquo; said Mowbray. &ldquo;Reginald Scrogie Mowbray
was his name. I have reason to consider his
alliance with my family as undoubted, though you
seem to mention it with a sneer, sir. I believe Mr.
S. Mowbray regulated his family settlements very
much upon the idea that his heir was to intermarry
with our house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;True, true, Mr. Mowbray,&rdquo; answered Touchwood;
&ldquo;and certainly it is not your business to lay
the axe to the root of the genealogical tree, that is
like to bear golden apples for you&mdash;Ha!&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_265" id="vol_ii_Page_265">[Pg&nbsp;265]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, well, sir&mdash;proceed&mdash;proceed,&rdquo; answered
Mowbray.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may also have heard that this old gentleman
had a son, who would willingly have cut up the
said family-tree into fagots; who thought Scrogie
sounded as well as Mowbray, and had no fancy for
an imaginary gentility, which was to be attained by
the change of one's natural name, and the disowning,
as it were, of one's actual relations.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I have heard from Lord Etherington,&rdquo;
answered Mowbray, &ldquo;to whose communications I
owe most of my knowledge about these Scrogie
people, that old Mr. Scrogie Mowbray was unfortunate
in a son, who thwarted his father on every
occasion,&mdash;would embrace no opportunity which
fortunate chances held out, of raising and distinguishing
the family,&mdash;had imbibed low tastes,
wandering habits, and singular objects of pursuit,&mdash;on
account of which his father disinherited him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is very true, Mr. Mowbray,&rdquo; proceeded
Touchwood, &ldquo;that this person did happen to fall
under his father's displeasure, because he scorned
forms and flummery,&mdash;loved better to make money
as an honest merchant, than to throw it away as an
idle gentleman,&mdash;never called a coach when walking
on foot would serve the turn,&mdash;and liked the
Royal Exchange better than St. James's Park. In
short, his father disinherited him, because he had
the qualities for doubling the estate, rather than
those for squandering it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All this may be quite correct, Mr. Touchwood,&rdquo;
replied Mowbray; &ldquo;but pray, what has this Mr.
Scrogie, junior, to do with you or me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do with you or me!&rdquo; said Touchwood, as if
surprised at the question; &ldquo;he has a great deal<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_266" id="vol_ii_Page_266">[Pg&nbsp;266]</a></span>
to do with me at least, since I am the very man
myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The devil you are!&rdquo; said Mowbray, opening
wide his eyes in turn; &ldquo;Why, Mr. A&mdash;a&mdash;your
name is Touchwood&mdash;P. Touchwood&mdash;Paul, I
suppose, or Peter&mdash;I read it so in the subscription
book at the Well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Peregrine, sir, Peregrine&mdash;my mother would
have me so christened, because Peregrine Pickle
came out during her confinement; and my poor
foolish father acquiesced, because he thought it
genteel, and derived from the Willoughbies. I
don't like it, and I always write P. short, and you
might have remarked an S. also before the surname&mdash;I
use at present P. S. Touchwood. I had an old
acquaintance in the city, who loved his jest&mdash;He
always called me Postscript Touchwood.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then, sir,&rdquo; said Mowbray, &ldquo;if you are really
Mr. Scrogie, <i>tout court</i>, I must suppose the name
of Touchwood is assumed?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What the devil!&rdquo; replied Mr. P. S. Touchwood,
&ldquo;do you suppose there is no name in the English
nation will couple up legitimately with my paternal
name of Scrogie, except your own, Mr. Mowbray?&mdash;I
assure you I got the name of Touchwood, and a
pretty spell of money along with it, from an old
godfather, who admired my spirit in sticking by
commerce.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, sir, every one has his taste&mdash;Many would
have thought it better to enjoy a hereditary estate,
by keeping your father's name of Mowbray, than
to have gained another by assuming a stranger's
name of Touchwood.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who told you Mr. Touchwood was a stranger
to me?&rdquo; said the traveller; &ldquo;for aught I know, he<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_267" id="vol_ii_Page_267">[Pg&nbsp;267]</a></span>
had a better title to the duties of a son from me,
than the poor old man who made such a fool of
himself, by trying to turn gentleman in his old
age. He was my grandfather's partner in the great
firm of Touchwood, Scrogie, and Co.&mdash;Let me tell
you, there is as good inheritance in house as in field&mdash;a
man's partners are his fathers and brothers, and
a head clerk may be likened to a kind of first cousin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I meant no offence whatever, Mr. Touchwood
Scrogie.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Scrogie Touchwood, if you please,&rdquo; said the
senior; &ldquo;the scrog branch first, for it must become
rotten ere it become touchwood&mdash;ha, ha, ha!&mdash;you
take me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A singular old fellow this,&rdquo; said Mowbray to
himself, &ldquo;and speaks in all the dignity of dollars;
but I will be civil to him, till I can see what he is
driving at.&mdash;You are facetious, Mr. Touchwood,&rdquo;
he proceeded aloud. &ldquo;I was only going to say,
that although you set no value upon your connexion
with my family, yet I cannot forget that
such a circumstance exists; and therefore I bid
you heartily welcome to Shaws-Castle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank ye, thank ye, Mr. Mowbray&mdash;I knew
you would see the thing right. To tell you the
truth, I should not have cared much to come a-begging
for your acquaintance and cousinship, and so
forth; but that I thought you would be more tractable
in your adversity, than was your father in his
prosperity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you know my father, sir?&rdquo; said Mowbray.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay&mdash;I came once down here, and was introduced
to him&mdash;saw your sister and you when you
were children&mdash;had thoughts of making my will
then, and should have clapped you both in before<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_268" id="vol_ii_Page_268">[Pg&nbsp;268]</a></span>
I set out to double Cape Horn. But, gad, I wish
my poor father had seen the reception I got! I
did not let the old gentleman, Mr. Mowbray of St.
Ronan's that was then, smoke my money-bags&mdash;that
might have made him more tractable&mdash;not but
that we went on indifferent well for a day or two,
till I got a hint that my room was wanted, for that
the Duke of Devil-knows-what was expected, and
my bed was to serve his valet-de-chambre.&mdash;&lsquo;Oh,
damn all gentle cousins!&rsquo; said I, and off I set on the
pad round the world again, and thought no more of
the Mowbrays till a year or so ago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And, pray, what recalled us to your recollection?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said Touchwood, &ldquo;I was settled for some
time at Smyrna, (for I turn the penny go where I
will&mdash;I have done a little business even since I
came here;)&mdash;but being at Smyrna as I said,
I became acquainted with Francis Tyrrel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The natural brother of Lord Etherington,&rdquo; said
Mowbray.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, so called,&rdquo; answered Touchwood; &ldquo;but
by and by he is more likely to prove the Earl
of Etherington himself, and t'other fine fellow
the bastard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The devil he is!&mdash;You surprise me, Mr.
Touchwood.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought I should&mdash;I thought I should&mdash;Faith,
I am sometimes surprised myself at the turn
things take in this world. But the thing is not the
less certain&mdash;the proofs are lying in the strong
chest of our house at London, deposited there by
the old Earl, who repented of his roguery to Miss
Martigny long before he died, but had not courage
enough to do his legitimate son justice till the
sexton had housed him.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_269" id="vol_ii_Page_269">[Pg&nbsp;269]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Good Heaven, sir!&rdquo; said Mowbray; &ldquo;and did
you know all this while, that I was about to bestow
the only sister of my house upon an impostor?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What was my business with that, Mr. Mowbray?&rdquo;
replied Touchwood; &ldquo;you would have been very
angry had any one suspected you of not being
sharp enough to look out for yourself and your
sister both. Besides, Lord Etherington, bad enough
as he may be in other respects, was, till very lately,
no impostor, or an innocent one, for he only occupied
the situation in which his father had placed
him. And, indeed, when I understood, upon coming
to England, that he was gone down here, and, as I
conjectured, to pay his addresses to your sister, to
say truth, I did not see he could do better. Here
was a poor fellow that was about to cease to be a
lord and a wealthy man; was it not very reasonable
that he should make the most of his dignity while
he had it? and if, by marrying a pretty girl while
in possession of his title, he could get possession of
the good estate of Nettlewood, why, I could see
nothing in it but a very pretty way of breaking
his fall.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very pretty for him, indeed, and very convenient
too,&rdquo; said Mowbray; &ldquo;but pray, sir, what was to
become of the honour of my family?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, what was the honour of your family to me?&rdquo;
said Touchwood; &ldquo;unless it was to recommend your
family to my care, that I was disinherited on account
of it. And if this Etherington, or Bulmer, had been
a good fellow, I would have seen all the Mowbrays
that ever wore broad cloth at Jericho, before I had
interfered.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am really much indebted to your kindness,&rdquo;
said Mowbray angrily.<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_270" id="vol_ii_Page_270">[Pg&nbsp;270]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;More than you are aware of,&rdquo; answered Touchwood;
&ldquo;for, though I thought this Bulmer, even
when declared illegitimate, might be a reasonable
good match for your sister, considering the estate
which was to accompany the union of their hands;
yet, now I have discovered him to be a scoundrel&mdash;every
way a scoundrel&mdash;I would not wish any
decent girl to marry him, were they to get all
Yorkshire, instead of Nettlewood. So I have come
to put you right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The strangeness of the news which Touchwood
so bluntly communicated, made Mowbray's head
turn round like that of a man who grows dizzy at
finding himself on the verge of a precipice. Touchwood
observed his consternation, which he willingly
construed into an acknowledgment of his own brilliant
genius.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take a glass of wine, Mr. Mowbray,&rdquo; he said,
complacently; &ldquo;take a glass of old sherry&mdash;nothing
like it for clearing the ideas&mdash;and do not be
afraid of me, though I come thus suddenly upon
you with such surprising tidings&mdash;you will find me
a plain, simple, ordinary man, that have my faults
and my blunders like other people. I acknowledge
that much travel and experience have made me
sometimes play the busybody, because I find I can
do things better than other people, and I love to
see folk stare&mdash;it's a way I have got. But, after
all, I am <i>un bon diable</i>, as the Frenchman says;
and here I have come four or five hundred miles to
lie quiet among you all, and put all your little matters
to rights, just when you think they are most
desperate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thank you for your good intentions,&rdquo; said
Mowbray; &ldquo;but I must needs say, that they would<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_271" id="vol_ii_Page_271">[Pg&nbsp;271]</a></span>
have been more effectual had you been less cunning
in my behalf, and frankly told me what you knew
of Lord Etherington; as it is, the matter has gone
fearfully far. I have promised him my sister&mdash;I
have laid myself under personal obligations to him&mdash;and
there are other reasons why I fear I must
keep my word to this man, earl or no earl.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; exclaimed Touchwood, &ldquo;would you
give up your sister to a worthless rascal, who is
capable of robbing the post-office, and of murdering
his brother, because you have lost a trifle of
money to him? Are you to let him go off triumphantly,
because he is a gamester as well as a
cheat?&mdash;You are a pretty fellow, Mr. Mowbray
of St. Ronan's&mdash;you are one of the happy sheep
that go out for wool, and come home shorn. Egad,
you think yourself a millstone, and turn out a sack
of grain&mdash;You flew abroad a hawk, and have come
home a pigeon&mdash;You snarled at the Philistines, and
they have drawn your eye-teeth with a vengeance!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is all very witty, Mr. Touchwood,&rdquo; replied
Mowbray; &ldquo;but wit will not pay this man Etherington,
or whatever he is, so many hundreds as I
have lost to him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, then, wealth must do what wit cannot,&rdquo;
said old Touchwood; &ldquo;I must advance for you,
that is all. Look ye, sir, I do not go afoot for
nothing&mdash;if I have laboured, I have reaped&mdash;and,
like the fellow in the old play, &lsquo;I have enough, and
can maintain my humour&rsquo;&mdash;it is not a few hundreds,
or thousands either, can stand betwixt old
P. S. Touchwood and his purpose; and my present
purpose is to make you, Mr. Mowbray of St.
Ronan's, a free man of the forest.&mdash;You still look
grave on it, young man?&mdash;Why, I trust you are<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_272" id="vol_ii_Page_272">[Pg&nbsp;272]</a></span>
not such an ass as to think your dignity offended,
because the plebeian Scrogie comes to the assistance
of the terribly great and old house of Mowbray?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am indeed not such a fool,&rdquo; answered Mowbray,
with his eyes still bent on the ground, &ldquo;to
reject assistance that comes to me like a rope to a
drowning man&mdash;but there is a circumstance&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;he
stopped short and drank a glass of wine&mdash;&ldquo;a
circumstance to which it is most painful to me to
allude&mdash;but you seem my friend&mdash;and I cannot
intimate to you more strongly my belief in your
professions of regard than by saying, that the language
held by Lady Penelope Penfeather on my
sister's account, renders it highly proper that she
were settled in life; and I cannot but fear, that
the breaking off the affair with this man might be
of great prejudice to her at this moment. They
will have Nettlewood, and they may live separate&mdash;he
has offered to make settlements to that effect,
even on the very day of marriage. Her condition
as a married woman will put her above scandal,
and above necessity, from which, I am sorry to say,
I cannot hope long to preserve her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For shame!&mdash;for shame!&mdash;for shame!&rdquo; said
Touchwood, accumulating his words thicker than
usual on each other; &ldquo;would you sell your own
flesh and blood to a man like this Bulmer, whose
character is now laid before you, merely because a
disappointed old maid speaks scandal of her? A
fine veneration you pay to the honoured name of
Mowbray! If my poor, old, simple father had known
what the owners of these two grand syllables could
have stooped to do for merely ensuring subsistence,
he would have thought as little of the noble
Mowbrays as of the humble Scrogies. And, I dare<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_273" id="vol_ii_Page_273">[Pg&nbsp;273]</a></span>
say, the young lady is just such another&mdash;eager
to get married&mdash;no matter to whom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Excuse me, Mr. Touchwood,&rdquo; answered Mowbray;
&ldquo;my sister entertains sentiments so very
different from what you ascribe to her, that she
and I parted on the most unpleasant terms, in consequence
of my pressing this man's suit upon her.
God knows, that I only did so, because I saw no
other outlet from this most unpleasant dilemma.
But, since you are willing to interfere, sir, and aid
me to disentangle these complicated matters, which
have, I own, been made worse by my own rashness,
I am ready to throw the matter completely into
your hands, just as if you were my father arisen
from the dead. Nevertheless, I must needs express
my surprise at the extent of your intelligence in
these affairs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You speak very sensibly, young man,&rdquo; said the
traveller; &ldquo;and as for my intelligence, I have for
some time known the finesses of this Master Bulmer
as perfectly as if I had been at his elbow when
he was playing all his dog's tricks with this family.
You would hardly suspect now,&rdquo; he continued, in
a confidential tone, &ldquo;that what you were so desirous
a while ago should take place, has in some
sense actually happened, and that the marriage ceremony
has really passed betwixt your sister and this
pretended Lord Etherington?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have a care, sir!&rdquo; said Mowbray, fiercely;
&ldquo;do not abuse my candour&mdash;this is no place, time,
or subject, for impertinent jesting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As I live by bread, I am serious,&rdquo; said Touchwood;
&ldquo;Mr. Cargill performed the ceremony; and
there are two living witnesses who heard them say
the words, &lsquo;I, Clara, take you, Francis,&rsquo; or whatever<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_274" id="vol_ii_Page_274">[Pg&nbsp;274]</a></span>
the Scottish church puts in place of that mystical
formula.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is impossible,&rdquo; said Mowbray; &ldquo;Cargill dared
not have done such a thing&mdash;a clandestine proceeding,
such as you speak of, would have cost him
his living. I'll bet my soul against a horse-shoe,
it is all an imposition; and you come to disturb me,
sir, amid my family distress, with legends that have
no more truth in them than the Alkoran.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are some true things in the Alkoran,
(or rather, the Koran, for the Al is merely the
article prefixed,) but let that pass&mdash;I will raise your
wonder higher before I am done. It is very true,
that your sister was indeed joined in marriage with
this same Bulmer, that calls himself by the title of
Etherington; but it is just as true, that the marriage
is not worth a maravedi, for she believed him
at the time to be another person&mdash;to be, in a word,
Francis Tyrrel, who is actually what the other pretends
to be, a nobleman of fortune.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot understand one word of all this,&rdquo; said
Mowbray. &ldquo;I must to my sister instantly, and
demand of her if there be any real foundation for
these wonderful averments.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do not go,&rdquo; said Touchwood, detaining him,
&ldquo;you shall have a full explanation from me; and
to comfort you under your perplexity, I can assure
you that Cargill's consent to celebrate the nuptials,
was only obtained by an aspersion thrown on your
sister's character, which induced him to believe
that speedy marriage would be the sole means of
saving her reputation; and I am convinced in my
own mind it is only the revival of this report which
has furnished the foundation of Lady Penelope's
chattering.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_275" id="vol_ii_Page_275">[Pg&nbsp;275]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;If I could think so&rdquo;&mdash;said Mowbray, &ldquo;if I
could but think this is truth&mdash;and it seems to
explain, in some degree, my sister's mysterious conduct&mdash;if
I could but think it true, I should fall
down and worship you as an angel from heaven!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A proper sort of angel,&rdquo; said Touchwood, looking
modestly down on his short, sturdy supporters&mdash;&ldquo;Did
you ever hear of an angel in boot-hose?
Or, do you suppose angels are sent to wait on broken-down
horse-jockeys?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Call me what you will, Mr. Touchwood,&rdquo; said
the young man, &ldquo;only make out your story true,
and my sister innocent!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well spoken, sir,&rdquo; answered the senior,
&ldquo;very well spoken! But then I understand, you
are to be guided by my prudence and experience?
None of your G&mdash; damme doings, sir&mdash;your duels
or your drubbings. Let <i>me</i> manage the affair for
you, and I will bring you through with a flowing
sail.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir, I must feel as a gentleman,&rdquo;&mdash;said
Mowbray.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Feel as a fool,&rdquo; said Touchwood, &ldquo;for that is
the true case. Nothing would please this Bulmer
better than to fight through his rogueries&mdash;he
knows very well, that he who can slit a pistol-ball
on the edge of a penknife, will always preserve
some sort of reputation amidst his scoundrelism&mdash;but
I shall take care to stop that hole. Sit down&mdash;be
a man of sense, and listen to the whole of
this strange story.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mowbray sat down accordingly; and Touchwood,
in his own way, and with many characteristic
interjectional remarks, gave him an account of the
early loves of Clara and Tyrrel&mdash;of the reasons<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_276" id="vol_ii_Page_276">[Pg&nbsp;276]</a></span>
which induced Bulmer at first to encourage their
correspondence, in hopes that his brother would,
by a clandestine marriage, altogether ruin himself
with his father&mdash;of the change which took place in
his views when he perceived the importance annexed
by the old Earl to the union of Miss Mowbray
with his apparent heir&mdash;of the desperate stratagem
which he endeavoured to play off, by substituting
himself in the room of his brother&mdash;and all the
consequences, which it is unnecessary to resume
here, as they are detailed at length by the perpetrator
himself, in his correspondence with Captain
Jekyl.</p>

<p>When the whole communication was ended,
Mowbray, almost stupified by the wonders he had
heard, remained for some time in a sort of reverie,
from which he only started to ask what evidence
could be produced of a story so strange.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The evidence,&rdquo; answered Touchwood, &ldquo;of one
who was a deep agent in all these matters, from
first to last&mdash;as complete a rogue, I believe, as the
devil himself, with this difference, that our mortal
fiend does not, I believe, do evil for the sake of
evil, but for the sake of the profit which attends it.
How far this plea will avail him in a court of conscience,
I cannot tell; but his disposition was so
far akin to humanity, that I have always found my
old acquaintance as ready to do good as harm, providing
he had the same <i>agio</i> upon the transaction.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;On my soul,&rdquo; said Mowbray, &ldquo;you must mean
Solmes! whom I have long suspected to be a deep
villain&mdash;and now he proves traitor to boot. How
the devil could you get into his intimacy, Mr.
Touchwood?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The case was particular,&rdquo; said Touchwood.<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_277" id="vol_ii_Page_277">[Pg&nbsp;277]</a></span>
&ldquo;Mr. Solmes, too active a member of the community
to be satisfied with managing the affairs which his
master intrusted to him, adventured in a little business
on his own account; and thinking, I suppose,
that the late Earl of Etherington had forgotten
fully to acknowledge his services, as valet to his
son, he supplied that defect by a small check on
our house for L.100, in name, and bearing the
apparent signature, of the deceased. This small
mistake being detected, Mr. Solmes, <i>porteur</i> of the
little billet, would have been consigned to the custody
of a Bow-street officer, but that I found means
to relieve him, on condition of his making known to
me the points of private history which I have just
been communicating to you. What I had known
of Tyrrel at Smyrna, had given me much interest
in him, and you may guess it was not lessened by
the distresses which he had sustained through his
brother's treachery. By this fellow's means, I have
counterplotted all his master's fine schemes. For
example, as soon as I learned Bulmer was coming
down here, I contrived to give Tyrrel an anonymous
hint, well knowing he would set off like the devil to
thwart him, and so I should have the whole dramatis
person&aelig; together, and play them all off against
each other, after my own pleasure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In that case,&rdquo; said Mr. Mowbray, &ldquo;your expedient
brought about the rencontre between the two
brothers, when both might have fallen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can't deny it&mdash;can't deny it,&rdquo; answered Scrogie,
a little discountenanced&mdash;&ldquo;a mere accident&mdash;no
one can guard every point.&mdash;Egad, but I had like to
have been baffled again, for Bulmer sent the lad
Jekyl, who is not such a black sheep neither but
what there are some white hairs about him, upon<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_278" id="vol_ii_Page_278">[Pg&nbsp;278]</a></span>
a treaty with Tyrrel, that my secret agent was not
admitted to. Gad, but I discovered the whole&mdash;you
will scarce guess how.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Probably not easily, indeed, sir,&rdquo; answered
Mowbray; &ldquo;for your sources of intelligence are
not the most obvious, any more than your mode of
acting the most simple or most comprehensible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would not have it so,&rdquo; said Touchwood;
&ldquo;simple men perish in their simplicity&mdash;I carry
my eye-teeth about me.&mdash;And for my source of
information&mdash;why, I played the eavesdropper, sir&mdash;listened&mdash;knew
my landlady's cupboard with the
double door&mdash;got into it as she has done many a
time.&mdash;Such a fine gentleman as you would rather
cut a man's throat, I suppose, than listen at a cupboard
door, though the object were to prevent
murder?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot say I should have thought of the
expedient, certainly, sir,&rdquo; said Mowbray.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did, though,&rdquo; said Scrogie, &ldquo;and learned
enough of what was going on, to give Jekyl a hint
that sickened him of his commission, I believe&mdash;so
the game is all in my own hands. Bulmer has no
one to trust to but Solmes, and Solmes tells me
every thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here Mowbray could not suppress a movement
of impatience.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish to God, sir, that since you were so kind
as to interest yourself in affairs so intimately concerning
my family, you had been pleased to act
with a little more openness towards me. Here
have I been for weeks the intimate of a damned
scoundrel, whose throat I ought to have cut for his
scandalous conduct to my sister. Here have I been
rendering her and myself miserable, and getting<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_279" id="vol_ii_Page_279">[Pg&nbsp;279]</a></span>
myself cheated every night by a swindler, whom
you, if it had been your pleasure, could have
unmasked by a single word. I do all justice to your
intentions, sir; but, upon my soul, I cannot help
wishing you had conducted yourself with more
frankness and less mystery; and I am truly afraid
your love of dexterity has been too much for your
ingenuity, and that you have suffered matters to
run into such a skein of confusion, as you yourself
will find difficulty in unravelling.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Touchwood smiled, and shook his head in all the
conscious pride of superior understanding. &ldquo;Young
man,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;when you have seen a little of the
world, and especially beyond the bounds of this
narrow island, you will find much more art and
dexterity necessary in conducting these businesses
to an issue, than occurs to a blind John Bull, or a
raw Scotchman. You will be then no stranger to
the policy of life, which deals in mining and countermining,&mdash;now
in making feints, now in thrusting
with forthright passes. I look upon you, Mr.
Mowbray, as a young man spoiled by staying at
home, and keeping bad company; and will make
it my business, if you submit yourself to my guidance,
to inform your understanding, so as to retrieve
your estate.&mdash;Don't&mdash;Don't answer me, sir!
because I know too well, by experience, how young
men answer on these subjects&mdash;they are conceited,
sir, as conceited as if they had been in all the four
quarters of the world. I hate to be answered, sir,
I hate it. And, to tell you the truth, it is because
Tyrrel has a fancy of answering me, that I rather
make you my confidant on this occasion, than him.
I would have had him throw himself into my arms,
and under my directions; but he hesitated&mdash;he<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_280" id="vol_ii_Page_280">[Pg&nbsp;280]</a></span>
hesitated, Mr. Mowbray&mdash;and I despise hesitation.
If he thinks he has wit enough to manage his own
matters, let him try it&mdash;let him try it. Not but
I will do all I can for him, in fitting time and
place; but I will let him dwell in his perplexities
and uncertainties for a little while longer. And so,
Mr. Mowbray, you see what sort of an odd fellow I
am, and you can satisfy me at once whether you
mean to come into my measures&mdash;only speak out
at once, sir, for I abhor hesitation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>While Touchwood thus spoke, Mowbray was
forming his resolution internally. He was not so
inexperienced as the senior supposed; at least, he
could plainly see that he had to do with an obstinate,
capricious old man, who, with the best intentions
in the world, chose to have every thing in his
own way; and, like most petty politicians, was disposed
to throw intrigue and mystery over matters
which had much better be prosecuted boldly and
openly. But he perceived at the same time, that
Touchwood, as a sort of relation, wealthy, childless,
and disposed to become his friend, was a person to
be conciliated, the rather that the traveller himself
had frankly owned that it was Francis Tyrrel's
want of deference towards him, which had forfeited,
or at least abated, his favour. Mowbray recollected,
also, that the circumstances under which he himself
stood, did not permit him to trifle with returning
gleams of good fortune. Subduing, therefore, the
haughtiness of temper proper to him as an only
son and heir, he answered respectfully, that, in his
condition, the advice and assistance of Mr. Scrogie
Touchwood were too important, not to be purchased
at the price of submitting his own judgment
to that of an experienced and sagacious friend.<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_281" id="vol_ii_Page_281">[Pg&nbsp;281]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well said, Mr. Mowbray,&rdquo; replied the senior,
&ldquo;well said. Let me once have the management of
your affairs, and we will brush them up for you
without loss of time.&mdash;I must be obliged to you for
a bed for the night, however&mdash;it is as dark as a
wolf's mouth; and if you will give orders to keep
the poor devil of a postilion, and his horses too,
why, I will be the more obliged to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mowbray applied himself to the bell. Patrick
answered the call, and was much surprised, when
the old gentleman, taking the word out of his entertainer's
mouth, desired a bed to be got ready, with
a little fire in the grate; &ldquo;for I take it, friend,&rdquo; he
went on, &ldquo;you have not guests here very often.&mdash;And
see that my sheets be not damp, and bid the
housemaid take care not to make the bed upon an
exact level, but let it slope from the pillow to the
footposts, at a declivity of about eighteen inches.&mdash;And
hark ye&mdash;get me a jug of barley-water, to
place by my bedside, with the squeeze of a lemon&mdash;or
stay, you will make it as sour as Beelzebub&mdash;bring
the lemon on a saucer, and I will mix it
myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Patrick listened like one of sense forlorn, his
head turning like a mandarin, alternately from the
speaker to his master, as if to ask the latter whether
this was all reality. The instant that Touchwood
stopped, Mowbray added his fiat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let every thing be done to make Mr. Touchwood
comfortable, in the way he wishes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aweel, sir,&rdquo; said Patrick, &ldquo;I shall tell Mally,
to be sure, and we maun do our best, and&mdash;but it's
unco late&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And, therefore,&rdquo; said Touchwood, &ldquo;the sooner
we get to bed the better, my old friend. I, for one,<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_282" id="vol_ii_Page_282">[Pg&nbsp;282]</a></span>
must be stirring early&mdash;I have business of life and
death&mdash;it concerns you too, Mr. Mowbray&mdash;but no
more of that till to-morrow.&mdash;And let the lad put
up his horses, and get him a bed somewhere.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Patrick here thought he had gotten upon firm
ground for resistance, for which, displeased with
the dictatorial manner of the stranger, he felt
considerably inclined.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye may catch us at that, if ye can,&rdquo; said
Patrick; &ldquo;there's nae post cattle come into our
stables&mdash;What do we ken, but that they may be
glandered, as the groom says?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We must take the risk to-night, Patrick,&rdquo; said
Mowbray, reluctantly enough&mdash;&ldquo;unless Mr. Touchwood
will permit the horses to come back early next
morning?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not I, indeed,&rdquo; said Touchwood; &ldquo;safe bind
safe find&mdash;it may be once away and aye away, and
we shall have enough to do to-morrow morning.
Moreover, the poor carrion are tired, and the merciful
man is merciful to his beast&mdash;and, in a word,
if the horses go back to St. Ronan's Well to-night,
I go there for company.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It often happens, owing, I suppose, to the perversity
of human nature, that subserviency in trifles
is more difficult to a proud mind, than compliance
in matters of more importance. Mowbray, like
other young gentlemen of his class, was finically
rigid in his stable discipline, and even Lord Etherington's
horses had not been admitted into that
<i>sanctum sanctorum</i>, into which he now saw himself
obliged to induct two wretched post-hacks. But
he submitted with the best grace he could; and
Patrick, while he left their presence, with lifted-up
hands and eyes to execute the orders he had<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_283" id="vol_ii_Page_283">[Pg&nbsp;283]</a></span>
received, could scarcely help thinking that the old
man must be the devil in disguise, since he could
thus suddenly control his fiery master, even in the
points which he had hitherto seemed to consider as
of most vital importance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Lord in his mercy haud a grip of this
puir family! for I, that was born in it, am like to
see the end of it.&rdquo; Thus ejaculated Patrick.<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_284" id="vol_ii_Page_284">[Pg&nbsp;284]</a></span></p>

</p>
<p class="citation">
<i>King Lear.</i><br />
</p>


<p>There was a wild uncertainty about Mowbray's
ideas, after he started from a feverish sleep on the
morning succeeding this memorable interview, that
his sister, whom he really loved as much as he was
capable of loving any thing, had dishonoured him
and her name; and the horrid recollection of their
last interview was the first idea which his waking
imagination was thrilled with. Then came Touchwood's
tale of exculpation&mdash;and he persuaded
himself, or strove to do so, that Clara must have
understood the charge he had brought against her
as referring to her attachment to Tyrrel, and its fatal
consequences. Again, still he doubted how that
could be&mdash;still feared that there must be more
behind than her reluctance to confess the fraud which
had been practised on her by Bulmer; and then,
again, he strengthened himself in the first and more
pleasing opinion, by recollecting that, averse as she
was to espouse the person he proposed to her, it
must have appeared to her the completion of ruin,
if he, Mowbray, should obtain knowledge of the
clandestine marriage.<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_285" id="vol_ii_Page_285">[Pg&nbsp;285]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;O yes,&rdquo; he said to himself, &ldquo;she would
think that this story would render me more eager
in the rascal's interest, as the best way of hushing
up such a discreditable affair&mdash;faith, and she would
have judged right too; for, had he actually been
Lord Etherington, I do not see what else she could
have done. But, not being Lord Etherington, and
an anointed scoundrel into the bargain, I will content
myself with cudgelling him to death so soon as
I can get out of the guardianship of this old, meddling,
obstinate, self-willed, busybody.&mdash;Then, what
is to be done for Clara?&mdash;This mock marriage was
a mere bubble, and both parties must draw stakes.
She likes this grave Don, who proves to be the stick
of the right tree, after all&mdash;so do not I, though
there be something lordlike about him. I was sure
a strolling painter could not have carried it off so.
She may marry him, I suppose, if the law is not
against it&mdash;then she has the earldom, and the Oaklands,
and Nettlewood, all at once.&mdash;Gad, we should
come in winners, after all&mdash;and, I dare say, this old
boy Touchwood is as rich as a Jew&mdash;worth a hundred
thousand at least&mdash;He is too peremptory to
be cut up for sixpence under a hundred thousand.&mdash;And
he talks of putting me to rights&mdash;I must not
wince&mdash;must stand still to be curried a little&mdash;Only,
I wish the law may permit Clara's being married
to this other earl.&mdash;A woman cannot marry two
brothers, that is certain:&mdash;but then, if she is not
married to the one of them in good and lawful form,
there can be no bar to her marrying the other, I
should think&mdash;I hope the lawyers will talk no nonsense
about it&mdash;I hope Clara will have no foolish
scruples.&mdash;But, by my word, the first thing I have
to hope is, that the thing is true, for it comes through<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_286" id="vol_ii_Page_286">[Pg&nbsp;286]</a></span>
but a suspicious channel. I'll away to Clara instantly&mdash;get
the truth out of her&mdash;and consider what is
to be done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus partly thought and partly spoke the young
Laird of St. Ronan's, hastily dressing himself, in
order to enquire into the strange chaos of events
which perplexed his imagination.</p>

<p>When he came down to the parlour where they
had supped last night, and where breakfast was
prepared this morning, he sent for a girl who acted
as his sister's immediate attendant, and asked, &ldquo;if
Miss Mowbray was yet stirring?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girl answered, &ldquo;she had not rung her bell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is past her usual hour,&rdquo; said Mowbray, &ldquo;but
she was disturbed last night. Go, Martha, tell her to
get up instantly&mdash;say I have excellent good news
for her&mdash;or, if her head aches, I will come and tell
them to her before she rises&mdash;go like lightning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Martha went, and returned in a minute or two.
&ldquo;I cannot make my mistress hear, sir, knock as
loud as I will. I wish,&rdquo; she added, with that love
of evil presage which is common in the lower ranks,
&ldquo;that Miss Clara may be well, for I never knew her
sleep so sound.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mowbray jumped from the chair into which he
had thrown himself, ran through the gallery, and
knocked smartly at his sister's door; there was no
answer. &ldquo;Clara, dear Clara!&mdash;Answer me but
one word&mdash;say but you are well. I frightened you
last night&mdash;I had been drinking wine&mdash;I was
violent&mdash;forgive me!&mdash;Come, do not be sulky&mdash;speak
but a single word&mdash;say but you are
well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He made the pauses longer betwixt every branch
of his address, knocked sharper and louder, listened<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_287" id="vol_ii_Page_287">[Pg&nbsp;287]</a></span>
more anxiously for an answer; at length he
attempted to open the door, but found it locked, or
otherwise secured. &ldquo;Does Miss Mowbray always
lock her door?&rdquo; he asked the girl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never knew her to do it before, sir; she leaves
it open that I may call her, and open the window-shutters.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She had too good reason for precaution last night,
thought her brother, and then remembered having
heard her bar the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, Clara,&rdquo; he continued, greatly agitated,
&ldquo;do not be silly; if you will not open the door, I
must force it, that's all; for how can I tell but that
you are sick, and unable to answer?&mdash;if you are
only sullen, say so.&mdash;She returns no answer,&rdquo; he
said, turning to the domestic, who was now joined
by Touchwood.</p>

<p>Mowbray's anxiety was so great, that it prevented
his taking any notice of his guest, and he proceeded
to say, without regarding his presence,
&ldquo;What is to be done?&mdash;she may be sick&mdash;she may
be asleep&mdash;she may have swooned; if I force the
door, it may terrify her to death in the present
weak state of her nerves.&mdash;Clara, dear Clara! do
but speak a single word, and you shall remain in
your own room as long as you please.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was no answer. Miss Mowbray's maid,
hitherto too much fluttered and alarmed to have
much presence of mind, now recollected a back-stair
which communicated with her mistress's room
from the garden, and suggested she might have
gone out that way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gone out,&rdquo; said Mowbray, in great anxiety, and
looking at the heavy fog, or rather small rain, which
blotted the November morning,&mdash;&ldquo;Gone out, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_288" id="vol_ii_Page_288">[Pg&nbsp;288]</a></span>
in weather like this!&mdash;But we may get into her
room from the back-stair.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So saying, and leaving his guest to follow or
remain as he thought proper, he flew rather than
walked to the garden, and found the private door
which led into it, from the bottom of the back-stair
above mentioned, was wide open. Full of vague,
but fearful apprehensions, he rushed up to the door
of his sister's apartment, which opened from her
dressing-room to the landing-place of the stair; it
was ajar, and that which communicated betwixt the
bedroom and dressing-room was half open. &ldquo;Clara,
Clara!&rdquo; exclaimed Mowbray, invoking her name
rather in an agony of apprehension, than as any
longer hoping for a reply. And his apprehension
was but too prophetic.</p>

<p>Miss Mowbray was not in that apartment; and,
from the order in which it was found, it was plain
she had neither undressed on the preceding night,
nor occupied the bed. Mowbray struck his forehead
in an agony of remorse and fear. &ldquo;I have
terrified her to death,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;she has fled into
the woods, and perished there!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Under the influence of this apprehension, Mowbray,
after another hasty glance around the
apartment, as if to assure himself that Clara was not
there, rushed again into the dressing-room, almost
overturning the traveller, who, in civility, had not
ventured to enter the inner apartment. &ldquo;You
are as mad as a <i>Hamako</i>,&rdquo;<a name="vol_ii_FNanchor_11_11" id="vol_ii_FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#vol_ii_Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> said the traveller;
&ldquo;let us consult together, and I am sure I can
contrive&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, d&mdash;n your contrivance!&rdquo; said Mowbray,<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_289" id="vol_ii_Page_289">[Pg&nbsp;289]</a></span>
forgetting all proposed respect in his natural impatience,
aggravated by his alarm; &ldquo;if you had
behaved straight-forward, and like a man of common
sense, this would not have happened!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;God forgive you, young man, if your reflections
are unjust,&rdquo; said the traveller, quitting the hold he
had laid upon Mowbray's coat; &ldquo;and God forgive
me too, if I have done wrong while endeavouring
to do for the best!&mdash;But may not Miss Mowbray
have gone down to the Well? I will order my
horses, and set off instantly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do, do,&rdquo; said Mowbray, recklessly; &ldquo;I thank you,
I thank you;&rdquo; and hastily traversing the garden,
as if desirous to get rid at once of his visitor and
his own thoughts, he took the shortest road to
a little postern-gate, which led into the extensive
copsewood, through some part of which Clara had
caused a walk to be cut to a little summer-house
built of rough shingles, covered with creeping
shrubs.</p>

<p>As Mowbray hastened through the garden, he
met the old man by whom it was kept, a native
of the south country, and an old dependent on the
family. &ldquo;Have you seen my sister?&rdquo; said Mowbray,
hurrying his words on each other with the
eagerness of terror.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What's your wull, St. Ronan's?&rdquo; answered the
old man, at once dull of hearing, and slow of
apprehension.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you seen Miss Clara?&rdquo; shouted Mowbray,
and muttered an oath or two at the gardener's
stupidity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In troth have I,&rdquo; replied the gardener, deliberately;
&ldquo;what suld ail me to see Miss Clara, St.
Ronan's?&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_290" id="vol_ii_Page_290">[Pg&nbsp;290]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;When, and where?&rdquo; eagerly demanded the
querist.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ou, just yestreen, after tey-time&mdash;afore ye cam
hame yoursell galloping sae fast,&rdquo; said old Joseph.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am as stupid as he, to put off my time in speaking
to such an old cabbage-stock!&rdquo; said Mowbray,
and hastened on to the postern-gate already mentioned,
leading from the garden into what was
usually called Miss Clara's walk. Two or three
domestics, whispering to each other, and with countenances
that showed grief, fear, and suspicion,
followed their master, desirous to be employed, yet
afraid to force their services on the fiery young man.</p>

<p>At the little postern he found some trace of her
he sought. The pass-key of Clara was left in the
lock. It was then plain that she must have passed
that way; but at what hour, or for what purpose,
Mowbray dared not conjecture. The path, after
running a quarter of a mile or more through an
open grove of oaks and sycamores, attained the
verge of the large brook, and became there steep and
rocky, difficult to the infirm, and alarming to the
nervous; often approaching the brink of a precipitous
ledge of rock, which in this place overhung the
stream, in some places brawling and foaming in
hasty current, and in others seeming to slumber in
deep and circular eddies. The temptations which
this dangerous scene must have offered an excited
and desperate spirit, came on Mowbray like the
blight of the Simoom, and he stood a moment to
gather breath and overcome these horrible anticipations,
ere he was able to proceed. His attendants
felt the same apprehension. &ldquo;Puir thing&mdash;puir
thing!&mdash;O, God send she may not have been left to
hersell!&mdash;God send she may have been upholden!&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_291" id="vol_ii_Page_291">[Pg&nbsp;291]</a></span>
were whispered by Patrick to the maidens, and by
them to each other.</p>

<p>At this moment the old gardener was heard behind
them, shouting, &ldquo;Master&mdash;St. Ronan's&mdash;Master&mdash;I
have fund&mdash;I have fund&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you found my sister?&rdquo; exclaimed the
brother, with breathless anxiety.</p>

<p>The old man did not answer till he came up, and
then, with his usual slowness of delivery, he replied
to his master's repeated enquiries, &ldquo;Na, I haena fund
Miss Clara, but I hae fund something ye wad be
wae to lose&mdash;your braw hunting-knife.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He put the implement into the hand of its owner,
who, recollecting the circumstances under which he
had flung it from him last night, and the now too
probable consequences of that interview, bestowed
on it a deep imprecation, and again hurled it from
him into the brook. The domestics looked at each
other, and recollecting each at the same time that
the knife was a favourite tool of their master, who
was rather curious in such articles, had little doubt
that his mind was affected, in a temporary way at
least, by his anxiety on his sister's account. He
saw their confused and inquisitive looks, and assuming
as much composure and presence of mind as he
could command, directed Martha, and her female
companions, to return and search the walks on the
other side of Shaws-Castle; and, finally, ordered
Patrick back to ring the bell, &ldquo;which,&rdquo; he said,
assuming a confidence that he was far from entertaining,
&ldquo;might call Miss Mowbray home from some
of her long walks.&rdquo; He farther desired his groom
and horses might meet him at the Clattering Brig,
so called from a noisy cascade which was formed by
the brook, above which was stretched a small foot<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_292" id="vol_ii_Page_292">[Pg&nbsp;292]</a></span>-bridge
of planks. Having thus shaken off his
attendants, he proceeded himself, with all the speed
he was capable of exerting, to follow out the path
in which he was at present engaged, which, being
a favourite walk with his sister, she might perhaps
have adopted from mere habit, when in a state of
mind, which, he had too much reason to fear, must
have put choice out of the question.</p>

<p>He soon reached the summer-house, which was
merely a seat covered overhead and on the sides,
open in front, and neatly paved with pebbles. This
little bower was perched, like a hawk's nest, almost
upon the edge of a projecting crag, the highest point
of the line of rock which we have noticed; and had
been selected by poor Clara, on account of the prospect
which it commanded down the valley. One of
her gloves lay on the small rustic table in the summer-house.
Mowbray caught it eagerly up. It was
drenched with wet&mdash;the preceding day had been
dry; so that, had she forgot it there in the morning,
or in the course of the day, it could not have been
in that state. She had certainly been there during
the night, when it rained heavily.</p>

<p>Mowbray, thus assured that Clara had been in
this place, while her passions and fears were so much
afloat as they must have been at her flight from her
father's house, cast a hurried and terrified glance
from the brow of the precipice into the deep stream
that eddied below. It seemed to him that, in the
sullen roar of the water, he heard the last groans of
his sister&mdash;the foam-flakes caught his eye, as if
they were a part of her garments. But a closer
examination showed that there was no appearance
of such a catastrophe. Descending the path on the
other side of the bower, he observed a foot-print in<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_293" id="vol_ii_Page_293">[Pg&nbsp;293]</a></span>
a place where the clay was moist and tenacious,
which, from the small size, and the shape of the
shoe, it appeared to him must be a trace of her
whom he sought. He hurried forward, therefore,
with as much speed, as yet permitted him to look
out keenly for similar impressions, of which it
seemed to him he remarked several, although less
perfect than the former, being much obliterated by
the quantity of rain that had since fallen,&mdash;a circumstance
seeming to prove that several hours had
elapsed since the person had passed.</p>

<p>At length, through the various turnings and
windings of a long and romantic path, Mowbray
found himself, without having received any satisfactory
intelligence, by the side of the brook, called
St. Ronan's Burn, at the place where it was crossed
by foot-passengers, by the Clattering Brig, and by
horsemen through a ford a little lower. At this
point the fugitive might have either continued her
wanderings through her paternal woods, by a path
which, after winding about a mile, returned to
Shaws-Castle, or she might have crossed the bridge,
and entered a broken horse-way, common to the
public, leading to the Aultoun of St. Ronan's.</p>

<p>Mowbray, after a moment's consideration, concluded
that the last was her most probable option.&mdash;He
mounted his horse, which the groom had
brought down according to order, and commanding
the man to return by the footpath, which he himself
could not examine, he proceeded to ride towards
the ford. The brook was swollen during the night,
and the groom could not forbear intimating to
his master, that there was considerable danger in
attempting to cross it. But Mowbray's mind and
feelings were too high-strung to permit him to<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_294" id="vol_ii_Page_294">[Pg&nbsp;294]</a></span>
listen to cautious counsel. He spurred the snorting
and reluctant horse into the torrent, though
the water, rising high on the upper side, broke both
over the pommel and the croupe of his saddle. It
was by exertion of great strength and sagacity, that
the good horse kept the ford-way. Had the stream
forced him down among the rocks, which lie below
the crossing-place, the consequences must have been
fatal. Mowbray, however, reached the opposite
side in safety, to the joy and admiration of the
servant, who stood staring at him during the adventure.
He then rode hastily towards the Aultoun,
determined, if he could not hear tidings of his
sister in that village, that he would spread the alarm,
and institute a general search after her, since her
elopement from Shaws-Castle could, in that case,
no longer be concealed. We must leave him, however,
in his present state of uncertainty, in order to
acquaint our readers with the reality of those evils,
which his foreboding mind and disturbed conscience
could only anticipate.<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_295" id="vol_ii_Page_295">[Pg&nbsp;295]</a></span></p>

<i>Old Play.</i><br />
</p>


<p>Grief, shame, confusion, and terror, had contributed
to overwhelm the unfortunate Clara Mowbray at
the moment when she parted with her brother,
after the stormy and dangerous interview which
it was our task to record in a former chapter. For
years, her life, her whole tenor of thought, had
been haunted by the terrible apprehension of a
discovery, and now the thing which she feared
had come upon her. The extreme violence of her
brother, which went so far as to menace her personal
safety, had united with the previous conflict
of passions, to produce a rapture of fear, which
probably left her no other free agency, than that
which she derived from the blind instinct which
urges flight, as the readiest resource in danger.</p>

<p>We have no means of exactly tracing the course
of this unhappy young woman. It is probable she
fled from Shaws-Castle, on hearing the arrival of
Mr. Touchwood's carriage, which she might mistake
for that of Lord Etherington; and thus, while
Mowbray was looking forward to the happier prospects
which the traveller's narrative seemed to open,<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_296" id="vol_ii_Page_296">[Pg&nbsp;296]</a></span>
his sister was contending with rain and darkness,
amidst the difficulties and dangers of the mountain
path which we have described. These were so great,
that a young woman more delicately brought up,
must either have lain down exhausted, or have been
compelled to turn her steps back to the residence
she had abandoned. But the solitary wanderings
of Clara had inured her to fatigue and to night-walks;
and the deeper causes of terror which urged
her to flight, rendered her insensible to the perils
of her way. She had passed the bower, as was
evident from her glove remaining there, and had
crossed the foot-bridge; although it was almost
wonderful, that, in so dark a night, she should have
followed with such accuracy a track, where the
missing a single turn by a cubit's length, might
have precipitated her into eternity.</p>

<p>It is probable, that Clara's spirits and strength
began in some degree to fail her, after she had proceeded
a little way on the road to the Aultoun; for
she had stopped at the solitary cottage inhabited
by the old female pauper, who had been for a time
the hostess of the penitent and dying Hannah
Irwin. Here, as the inmate of the cottage acknowledged,
she had made some knocking, and she owned
she had heard her moan bitterly, as she entreated
for admission. The old hag was one of those whose
hearts adversity turns to very stone, and obstinately
kept her door shut, impelled more probably by
general hatred to the human race, than by the
superstitious fears which seized her; although she
perversely argued that she was startled at the
supernatural melody and sweetness of tone, with
which the benighted wanderer made her supplication.
She admitted, that when she heard the poor<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_297" id="vol_ii_Page_297">[Pg&nbsp;297]</a></span>
petitioner turn from the door, her heart was softened,
and she did intend to open with the purpose
of offering her at least a shelter; but that before
she could &ldquo;hirple to the door, and get the bar taken
down,&rdquo; the unfortunate supplicant was not to be
seen; which strengthened the old woman's opinion,
that the whole was a delusion of Satan.</p>

<p>It is conjectured that the repulsed wanderer made
no other attempt to awaken pity or obtain shelter,
until she came to Mr. Cargill's Manse, in the upper
room of which a light was still burning, owing to a
cause which requires some explanation.</p>

<p>The reader is aware of the reasons which induced
Bulmer, or the titular Lord Etherington, to withdraw
from the country the sole witness, as he
conceived, who could, or at least who might choose
to bear witness to the fraud which he had practised
on the unfortunate Clara Mowbray. Of three persons
present at the marriage, besides the parties,
the clergyman was completely deceived. Solmes he
conceived to be at his own exclusive devotion; and
therefore, if by his means this Hannah Irwin could
be removed from the scene, he argued plausibly,
that all evidence to the treachery which he had
practised would be effectually stifled. Hence his
agent, Solmes, had received a commission, as the
reader may remember, to effect her removal without
loss of time, and had reported to his master that
his efforts had been effectual.</p>

<p>But Solmes, since he had fallen under the influence
of Touchwood, was constantly employed in
counteracting the schemes which he seemed most
active in forwarding, while the traveller enjoyed (to
him an exquisite gratification) the amusement of
countermining as fast as Bulmer could mine, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_298" id="vol_ii_Page_298">[Pg&nbsp;298]</a></span>
had in prospect the pleasing anticipation of blowing
up the pioneer with his own petard. For this purpose,
as soon as Touchwood learned that his house
was to be applied to for the original deeds left in
charge by the deceased Earl of Etherington, he
expedited a letter, directing that only the copies
should be sent, and thus rendered nugatory Bulmer's
desperate design of possessing himself of that
evidence. For the same reason, when Solmes
announced to him his master's anxious wish to
have Hannah Irwin conveyed out of the country,
he appointed him to cause the sick woman to be
carefully transported to the Manse, where Mr.
Cargill was easily induced to give her temporary
refuge.</p>

<p>To this good man, who might be termed an
Israelite without guile, the distress of the unhappy
woman would have proved a sufficient recommendation;
nor was he likely to have enquired whether
her malady might not be infectious, or to have made
any of those other previous investigations which are
sometimes clogs upon the bounty or hospitality of
more prudent philanthropists. But to interest him
yet farther, Mr. Touchwood informed him by letter
that the patient (not otherwise unknown to him)
was possessed of certain most material information
affecting a family of honour and consequence, and
that he himself, with Mr. Mowbray of St. Ronan's
in the quality of a magistrate, intended to be at the
Manse that evening, to take her declaration upon
this important subject. Such indeed was the traveller's
purpose, which might have been carried into
effect, but for his own self-important love of man&oelig;uvring
on the one part, and the fiery impatience
of Mowbray on the other, which, as the reader<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_299" id="vol_ii_Page_299">[Pg&nbsp;299]</a></span>
knows, sent the one at full gallop to Shaws-Castle,
and obliged the other to follow him post haste. This
necessity he intimated to the clergyman by a note,
which he dispatched express as he himself was in
the act of stepping into the chaise.</p>

<p>He requested that the most particular attention
should be paid to the invalid&mdash;promised to be at
the Manse with Mr. Mowbray early on the morrow&mdash;and,
with the lingering and inveterate self-conceit
which always induced him to conduct every
thing with his own hand, directed his friend, Mr.
Cargill, not to proceed to take the sick woman's
declaration or confession until he arrived, unless in
case of extremity.</p>

<p>It had been an easy matter for Solmes to transfer
the invalid from the wretched cottage to the
clergyman's Manse. The first appearance of the
associate of much of her guilt had indeed terrified
her; but he scrupled not to assure her, that his
penitence was equal to her own, and that he was
conveying her where their joint deposition would
be formally received, in order that they might, so
far as possible, atone for the evil of which they had
been jointly guilty. He also promised her kind
usage for herself, and support for her children; and
she willingly accompanied him to the clergyman's
residence, he himself resolving to abide in concealment
the issue of the mystery, without again facing
his master, whose star, as he well discerned, was
about to shoot speedily from its exalted sphere.</p>

<p>The clergyman visited the unfortunate patient,
as he had done frequently during her residence in
his vicinity, and desired that she might be carefully
attended. During the whole day, she seemed better;
but, whether the means of supporting her<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_300" id="vol_ii_Page_300">[Pg&nbsp;300]</a></span>
exhausted frame had been too liberally administered,
or whether the thoughts which gnawed her conscience
had returned with double severity when she
was released from the pressure of immediate want,
it is certain that, about midnight, the fever began
to gain ground, and the person placed in attendance
on her came to inform the clergyman, then deeply
engaged with the siege of Ptolemais, that she doubted
if the woman would live till morning, and that
she had something lay heavy at her heart, which
she wished, as the emissary expressed it, &ldquo;to make,
a clean breast of&rdquo; before she died, or lost possession
of her senses.</p>

<p>Awakened by such a crisis, Mr. Cargill at once
became a man of this world, clear in his apprehension,
and cool in his resolution, as he always was
when the path of duty lay before him. Comprehending,
from the various hints of his friend Touchwood,
that the matter was of the last consequence, his
own humanity, as well as inexperience, dictated
his sending for skilful assistance. His man-servant
was accordingly dispatched on horseback to the
Well for Dr. Quackleben; while, upon the suggestion
of one of his maids, &ldquo;that Mrs. Dods was
an uncommon skeely body about a sick-bed,&rdquo; the
wench was dismissed to supplicate the assistance
of the gudewife of the Cleikum, which she was not,
indeed, wont to refuse whenever it could be useful.
The male emissary proved, in Scottish phrase, a
&ldquo;corbie messenger;&rdquo;<a name="vol_ii_FNanchor_G_19" id="vol_ii_FNanchor_G_19"></a><a href="#vol_ii_Footnote_G_19" class="fnanchor">[G]</a> for either he did not find
the doctor, or he found him better engaged than to
attend the sick-bed of a pauper, at a request which
promised such slight remuneration as that of a parish
minister. But the female ambassador was more
successful; for, though she found our friend Luckie<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_301" id="vol_ii_Page_301">[Pg&nbsp;301]</a></span>
Dods preparing for bed at an hour unusually late,
in consequence of some anxiety on account of Mr.
Touchwood's unexpected absence, the good old
dame only growled a little about the minister's fancies
in taking puir bodies into his own house; and
then, instantly donning cloak, hood, and pattens,
marched down the gate with all the speed of the
good Samaritan, one maid bearing the lantern before
her, while the other remained to keep the house, and
to attend to the wants of Mr. Tyrrel, who engaged
willingly to sit up to receive Mr. Touchwood.</p>

<p>But, ere Dame Dods had arrived at the Manse, the
patient had summoned Mr. Cargill to her presence,
and required him to write her confession while she
had life and breath to make it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For I believe,&rdquo; she added, raising herself in the
bed, and rolling her eyes wildly around, &ldquo;that,
were I to confess my guilt to one of a less sacred
character, the Evil Spirit, whose servant I have
been, would carry away his prey, both body and
soul, before they had severed from each other,
however short the space that they must remain in
partnership!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Cargill would have spoken some ghostly consolation,
but she answered with pettish impatience,
&ldquo;Waste not words&mdash;waste not words!&mdash;Let me
speak that which I must tell, and sign it with my
hand; and do you, as the more immediate servant
of God, and therefore bound to bear witness to the
truth, take heed you write that which I tell you,
and nothing else. I desired to have told this to
St. Ronan's&mdash;I have even made some progress in
telling it to others&mdash;but I am glad I broke short
off&mdash;for I know you, Josiah Cargill, though you
have long forgotten me.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_302" id="vol_ii_Page_302">[Pg&nbsp;302]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It may be so,&rdquo; said Cargill. &ldquo;I have indeed
no recollection of you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You once knew Hannah Irwin, though,&rdquo; said
the sick woman, &ldquo;who was companion and relation
to Miss Clara Mowbray, and who was present with
her on that sinful night, when she was wedded in
the kirk of St. Ronan's.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you mean to say that you are that person?&rdquo;
said Cargill, holding the candle so as to throw some
light on the face of the sick woman. &ldquo;I cannot
believe it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No?&rdquo; replied the penitent; &ldquo;there is indeed
a difference between wickedness in the act of
carrying through its successful machinations, and
wickedness surrounded by all the horrors of a
death-bed!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do not yet despair,&rdquo; said Cargill. &ldquo;Grace is omnipotent&mdash;to
doubt this is in itself a great crime.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be it so!&mdash;I cannot help it&mdash;my heart is
hardened, Mr. Cargill; and there is something here,&rdquo;
she pressed her bosom, &ldquo;which tells me, that, with
prolonged life and renewed health, even my present
agonies would be forgotten, and I should become
the same I have been before. I have rejected the
offer of grace, Mr. Cargill, and not through ignorance,
for I have sinned with my eyes open. Care not
for me, then, who am a mere outcast.&rdquo; He again
endeavoured to interrupt her, but she continued,
&ldquo;Or if you really wish my welfare, let me relieve
my bosom of that which presses it, and it may be
that I shall then be better able to listen to you.
You say you remember me not&mdash;but if I tell
you how often you refused to perform in secret
the office which was required of you&mdash;how much
you urged that it was against your canonical rules<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_303" id="vol_ii_Page_303">[Pg&nbsp;303]</a></span>&mdash;if
I name the argument to which you yielded&mdash;and
remind you of your purpose, to acknowledge
your transgression to your brethren in the church
courts, to plead your excuse, and submit to their
censure, which you said could not be a light one&mdash;you
will be then aware, that, in the voice of the
miserable pauper, you hear the words of the once
artful, gay, and specious Hannah Irwin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I allow it&mdash;I allow it!&rdquo; said Mr. Cargill; &ldquo;I
admit the tokens, and believe you to be indeed her
whose name you assume.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then one painful step is over,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;for
I would ere now have lightened my conscience by
confession, saving for the cursed pride of spirit,
which was ashamed of poverty, though it had not
shrunk from guilt.&mdash;Well&mdash;In these arguments,
which were urged to you by a youth best known
to you by the name of Francis Tyrrel, though more
properly entitled to that of Valentine Bulmer, we
practised on you a base and gross deception.&mdash;Did
you not hear some one sigh?&mdash;I hope there is no
one in the room&mdash;I trust I shall die when my confession
is signed and sealed, without my name being
dragged through the public&mdash;I hope ye bring not
in your menials to gaze on my abject misery&mdash;I
cannot brook that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She paused and listened; for the ear, usually
deafened by pain, is sometimes, on the contrary,
rendered morbidly acute. Mr. Cargill assured her,
there was no one present but himself. &ldquo;But, O,
most unhappy woman!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;what does your
introduction prepare me to expect!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your expectation, be it ever so ominous, shall
be fully satisfied.&mdash;I was the guilty confidant of
the false Francis Tyrrel.&mdash;Clara loved the true<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_304" id="vol_ii_Page_304">[Pg&nbsp;304]</a></span>
one.&mdash;When the fatal ceremony passed, the bride
and the clergyman were deceived alike&mdash;and I
was the wretch&mdash;the fiend&mdash;who, aiding another
yet blacker, if blacker could be&mdash;mainly helped
to accomplish this cureless misery!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wretch!&rdquo; exclaimed the clergyman, &ldquo;and had
you not then done enough?&mdash;Why did you expose
the betrothed of one brother to become the wife of
another?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I acted,&rdquo; said the sick woman, &ldquo;only as Bulmer
instructed me; but I had to do with a master of
the game. He contrived, by his agent Solmes, to
match me with a husband imposed on me by his
devices as a man of fortune!&mdash;a wretch, who maltreated
me&mdash;plundered me&mdash;sold me.&mdash;Oh! if
fiends laugh, as I have heard they can, what a
jubilee of scorn will there be, when Bulmer and I
enter their place of torture!&mdash;Hark!&mdash;I am sure
of it&mdash;some one draws breath, as if shuddering!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will distract yourself if you give way to
these fancies. Be calm&mdash;speak on&mdash;but, oh! at
last, and for once, speak the truth!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will, for it will best gratify my hatred against
him, who, having first robbed me of my virtue,
made me a sport and a plunder to the basest of the
species. For that I wandered here to unmask him.
I had heard he again stirred his suit to Clara, and
I came here to tell young Mowbray the whole.&mdash;But
do you wonder that I shrunk from doing so
till this last decisive moment?&mdash;I thought of my
conduct to Clara, and how could I face her brother?&mdash;And
yet I hated her not after I learned her utter
wretchedness&mdash;her deep misery, verging even upon
madness&mdash;I hated her not then. I was sorry that
she was not to fall to the lot of a better man than<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_305" id="vol_ii_Page_305">[Pg&nbsp;305]</a></span>
Bulmer;&mdash;and I pitied her after she was rescued
by Tyrrel, and you may remember it was I who
prevailed on you to conceal her marriage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I remember it,&rdquo; answered Cargill, &ldquo;and that
you alleged, as a reason for secrecy, danger from
her family. I did conceal it, until reports that she
was again to be married reached my ears.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; said the sick woman, &ldquo;Clara
Mowbray ought to forgive me&mdash;since what ill I
have done her was inevitable, while the good I did
was voluntary.&mdash;I must see her, Josiah Cargill&mdash;I
must see her before I die&mdash;I shall never pray till
I see her&mdash;I shall never profit by word of godliness
till I see her! If I cannot obtain the pardon
of a worm like myself, how can I hope for that
of&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>She started at these words with a faint scream;
for slowly, and with a feeble hand, the curtains of
the bed opposite to the side at which Cargill sat,
were opened, and the figure of Clara Mowbray, her
clothes and long hair drenched and dripping with
rain, stood in the opening by the bedside. The
dying woman sat upright, her eyes starting from
their sockets, her lips quivering, her face pale, her
emaciated hands grasping the bed-clothes, as if to
support herself, and looking as much aghast as if
her confession had called up the apparition of her
betrayed friend.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hannah Irwin,&rdquo; said Clara, with her usual
sweetness of tone, &ldquo;my early friend&mdash;my unprovoked
enemy!&mdash;Betake thee to Him who hath
pardon for us all, and betake thee with confidence&mdash;for
I pardon you as freely as if you had never
wronged me&mdash;as freely as I desire my own pardon.&mdash;Farewell&mdash;Farewell!&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_306" id="vol_ii_Page_306">[Pg&nbsp;306]</a></span></p>

<p>She retired from the room, ere the clergyman
could convince himself that it was more than a
phantom which he beheld. He ran down stairs&mdash;he
summoned assistants, but no one could attend
his call; for the deep ruckling groans of the patient
satisfied every one that she was breathing her last;
and Mrs. Dods, with the maid-servant, ran into the
bedroom, to witness the death of Hannah Irwin,
which shortly after took place.</p>

<p>That event had scarcely occurred, when the
maid-servant who had been left in the inn, came
down in great terror to acquaint her mistress, that
a lady had entered the house like a ghost, and was
dying in Mr. Tyrrel's room. The truth of the story
we must tell our own way.</p>

<p>In the irregular state of Miss Mowbray's mind,
a less violent impulse than that which she had
received from her brother's arbitrary violence, added
to the fatigues, dangers, and terrors of her night-walk,
might have exhausted the powers of her
body, and alienated those of her mind. We have
before said, that the lights in the clergyman's house
had probably attracted her attention, and in the
temporary confusion of a family, never remarkable
for its regularity, she easily mounted the stairs,
and entered the sick chamber undiscovered, and
thus overheard Hannah Irwin's confession, a tale
sufficient to have greatly aggravated her mental
malady.</p>

<p>We have no means of knowing whether she actually
sought Tyrrel, or whether it was, as in the
former case, the circumstance of a light still burning
where all around was dark, that attracted her;
but her next apparition was close by the side of
her unfortunate lover, then deeply engaged in writ<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_307" id="vol_ii_Page_307">[Pg&nbsp;307]</a></span>ing,
when something suddenly gleamed on a large,
old-fashioned mirror, which hung on the wall opposite.
He looked up, and saw the figure of Clara,
holding a light (which she had taken from the
passage) in her extended hand. He stood for an
instant with his eyes fixed on this fearful shadow,
ere he dared turn round on the substance which
was thus reflected. When he did so, the fixed and
pallid countenance almost impressed him with the
belief that he saw a vision, and he shuddered when,
stooping beside him, she took his hand. &ldquo;Come
away!&rdquo; she said, in a hurried voice&mdash;&ldquo;Come away,
my brother follows to kill us both. Come, Tyrrel,
let us fly&mdash;we shall easily escape him.&mdash;Hannah
Irwin is on before&mdash;but, if we are overtaken, I will
have no more fighting&mdash;you must promise me that
we shall not&mdash;we have had but too much of that&mdash;but
you will be wise in future.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 417px;">
<img src="images/illus-2_307.jpg" width="417" height="600" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Clara Mowbray!&rdquo; exclaimed Tyrrel. &ldquo;Alas!
is it thus?&mdash;Stay&mdash;do not go,&rdquo; for she turned to
make her escape&mdash;&ldquo;stay&mdash;stay&mdash;sit down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must go,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;I must go&mdash;I am
called&mdash;Hannah Irwin is gone before to tell all,
and I must follow. Will you not let me go?&mdash;Nay,
if you will hold me by force, I know I must
sit down&mdash;but you will not be able to keep me for
all that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A convulsion fit followed, and seemed, by its violence,
to explain that she was indeed bound for the
last and darksome journey. The maid, who at
length answered Tyrrel's earnest and repeated summons,
fled terrified at the scene she witnessed, and
carried to the Manse the alarm which we before
mentioned.</p>

<p>The old landlady was compelled to exchange one<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_308" id="vol_ii_Page_308">[Pg&nbsp;308]</a></span>
scene of sorrow for another, wondering within herself
what fatality could have marked this single night
with so much misery. When she arrived at home,
what was her astonishment to find there the daughter
of the house, which, even in their alienation,
she had never ceased to love, in a state little short
of distraction, and tended by Tyrrel, whose state
of mind seemed scarce more composed than that of
the unhappy patient. The oddities of Mrs. Dods
were merely the rust which had accumulated upon
her character, but without impairing its native
strength and energy; and her sympathies were not
of a kind acute enough to disable her from thinking
and acting as decisively as circumstances required.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Tyrrel,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;this is nae sight for
men folk&mdash;ye maun rise and gang to another
room.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will not stir from her,&rdquo; said Tyrrel&mdash;&ldquo;I will
not remove from her either now, or as long as she
or I may live.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That will be nae lang space, Maister Tyrrel,
if ye winna be ruled by common sense.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tyrrel started up, as if half comprehending what
she said, but remained motionless.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, come,&rdquo; said the compassionate landlady;
&ldquo;do not stand looking on a sight sair enough to
break a harder heart than yours, hinny&mdash;your ain
sense tells ye, ye canna stay here&mdash;Miss Clara shall
be weel cared for, and I'll bring word to your room-door
frae half-hour to half-hour how she is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The necessity of the case was undeniable, and
Tyrrel suffered himself to be led to another apartment,
leaving Miss Mowbray to the care of the hostess
and her female assistants. He counted the
hours in an agony, less by the watch than by<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_309" id="vol_ii_Page_309">[Pg&nbsp;309]</a></span>
the visits which Mrs. Dods, faithful to her promise,
made from interval to interval, to tell him that
Clara was not better&mdash;that she was worse&mdash;and,
at last, that she did not think she could live over
morning. It required all the deprecatory influence
of the good landlady to restrain Tyrrel, who, calm
and cold on common occasions, was proportionally
fierce and impetuous when his passions were afloat,
from bursting into the room, and ascertaining, with
his own eyes, the state of the beloved patient. At
length there was a long interval&mdash;an interval of
hours&mdash;so long, indeed, that Tyrrel caught from it
the flattering hope that Clara slept, and that sleep
might bring refreshment both to mind and body.
Mrs. Dods, he concluded, was prevented from moving,
for fear of disturbing her patient's slumber;
and, as if actuated by the same feeling which he
imputed to her, he ceased to traverse his apartment,
as his agitation had hitherto dictated, and throwing
himself into a chair, forbore to move even a finger,
and withheld his respiration as much as possible,
just as if he had been seated by the pillow of the
patient. Morning was far advanced, when his landlady
appeared in his room with a grave and anxious
countenance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Tyrrel,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;ye are a Christian man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush, hush, for Heaven's sake!&rdquo; he replied;
&ldquo;you will disturb Miss Mowbray.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Naething will disturb her, puir thing,&rdquo; answered
Mrs. Dods; &ldquo;they have muckle to answer for that
brought her to this!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They have&mdash;they have indeed,&rdquo; said Tyrrel,
striking his forehead; &ldquo;and I will see her avenged
on every one of them!&mdash;Can I see her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Better not&mdash;better not,&rdquo; said the good woman;<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_310" id="vol_ii_Page_310">[Pg&nbsp;310]</a></span>
but he burst from her, and rushed into the
apartment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is life gone?&mdash;Is every spark extinct?&rdquo; he
exclaimed eagerly to a country surgeon, a sensible
man, who had been summoned from Marchthorn in
the course of the night. The medical man shook
his head&mdash;Tyrrel rushed to the bedside, and was
convinced by his own eyes that the being whose
sorrows he had both caused and shared, was now
insensible to all earthly calamity. He raised almost
a shriek of despair, as he threw himself on the pale
hand of the corpse, wet it with tears, devoured it
with kisses, and played for a short time the part of
a distracted person. At length, on the repeated
expostulation of all present, he suffered himself to be
again conducted to another apartment, the surgeon
following, anxious to give such sad consolation as
the case admitted of.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As you are so deeply concerned for the untimely
fate of this young lady,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it may be some
satisfaction to you, though a melancholy one, to
know, that it has been occasioned by a pressure on
the brain, probably accompanied by a suffusion;
and I feel authorized in stating, from the symptoms,
that if life had been spared, reason would, in all
probability, never have returned. In such a case,
sir, the most affectionate relation must own, that
death, in comparison to life, is a mercy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mercy?&rdquo; answered Tyrrel; &ldquo;but why, then,
is it denied to me?&mdash;I know&mdash;I know!&mdash;My life
is spared till I revenge her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He started from his seat, and hurried eagerly
down stairs. But, as he was about to rush from the
door of the inn, he was stopped by Touchwood,
who had just alighted from a carriage, with an air<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_311" id="vol_ii_Page_311">[Pg&nbsp;311]</a></span>
of stern anxiety imprinted on his features, very
different from their usual expression. &ldquo;Whither
would ye? Whither would ye?&rdquo; he said, laying
hold of Tyrrel, and stopping him by force.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For revenge&mdash;for revenge!&rdquo; said Tyrrel.
&ldquo;Give way, I charge you, on your peril!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Vengeance belongs to God,&rdquo; replied the old man,
&ldquo;and his bolt has fallen.&mdash;This way&mdash;this way,&rdquo;
he continued, dragging Tyrrel into the house.
&ldquo;Know,&rdquo; he said, so soon as he had led or forced
him into a chamber, &ldquo;that Mowbray of St. Ronan's
has met Bulmer within this half hour, and has killed
him on the spot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Killed?&mdash;whom?&rdquo; answered the bewildered
Tyrrel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Valentine Bulmer, the titular Earl of
Etherington.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You bring tidings of death to the house of
death,&rdquo; answered Tyrrel; &ldquo;and there is nothing in
this world left that I should live for!&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_312" id="vol_ii_Page_312">[Pg&nbsp;312]</a></span></p>

<i>Old Play.</i><br />
</p>


<p>When Mowbray crossed the brook, as we have
already detailed, his mind was in that wayward and
uncertain state, which seeks something whereon to
vent the self-engendered rage with which it labours,
like a volcano before eruption. On a sudden, a
shot or two, followed by loud voices and laughter
reminded him he had promised, at that hour, and
in that sequestered place, to decide a bet respecting
pistol-shooting, to which the titular Lord Etherington,
Jekyl, and Captain MacTurk, to whom such a
pastime was peculiarly congenial, were parties as
well as himself. The prospect this recollection
afforded him, of vengeance on the man whom he
regarded as the author of his sister's wrongs, was,
in the present state of his mind, too tempting to be
relinquished; and, setting spurs to his horse, he
rushed through the copse to the little glade, where
he found the other parties, who, despairing of his
arrival, had already begun their amusement. A
jubilee shout was set up as he approached.<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_313" id="vol_ii_Page_313">[Pg&nbsp;313]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Here comes Mowbray, dripping, by Cot, like a
watering-pan,&rdquo; said Captain MacTurk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I fear him not,&rdquo; said Etherington, (we may as
well still call him so,) &ldquo;he has ridden too fast to
have steady nerves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We shall soon see that, my Lord Etherington,
or rather Mr. Valentine Bulmer,&rdquo; said Mowbray,
springing from his horse, and throwing the bridle
over the bough of a tree.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What does this mean, Mr. Mowbray?&rdquo; said
Etherington, drawing himself up, while Jekyl and
Captain MacTurk looked at each other in surprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It means, sir, that you are a rascal and impostor,&rdquo;
replied Mowbray, &ldquo;who have assumed a name
to which you have no right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That, Mr. Mowbray, is an insult I cannot carry
farther than this spot,&rdquo; said Etherington.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you had been willing to do so, you should
have carried with it something still harder to be
borne,&rdquo; answered Mowbray.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Enough, enough, my good sir; no use in spurring
a willing horse.&mdash;Jekyl, you will have the
kindness to stand by me in this matter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly, my lord,&rdquo; said Jekyl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And, as there seems to be no chance of taking
up the matter amicably,&rdquo; said the pacific Captain
MacTurk, &ldquo;I will be most happy, so help me, to
assist my worthy friend, Mr. Mowbray of St. Ronan's,
with my countenance and advice.&mdash;Very goot
chance that we were here with the necessary
weapons, since it would have been an unpleasant
thing to have such an affair long upon the stomach,
any more than to settle it without witnesses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would fain know first,&rdquo; said Jekyl, &ldquo;what all
this sudden heat has arisen about.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_314" id="vol_ii_Page_314">[Pg&nbsp;314]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;About nothing,&rdquo; said Etherington, &ldquo;except a
mare's nest of Mr. Mowbray's discovering. He
always knew his sister played the madwoman, and
he has now heard a report, I suppose, that she has
likewise in her time played the &mdash;&mdash; fool.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, crimini!&rdquo; cried Captain MacTurk, &ldquo;my
good Captain, let us pe loading and measuring out&mdash;for,
by my soul, if these sweetmeats be passing
between them, it is only the twa ends of a hankercher
than can serve the turn&mdash;Cot tamn!&rdquo;</p>

<p>With such friendly intentions, the ground was
hastily meted out. Each was well known as an
excellent shot; and the Captain offered a bet to
Jekyl of a mutchkin of Glenlivat, that both would
fall by the first fire. The event showed that he
was nearly right; for the ball of Lord Etherington
grazed Mowbray's temple, at the very second of time
when Mowbray's pierced his heart. He sprung a
yard from the ground, and fell down a dead man.
Mowbray stood fixed like a pillar of stone, his arm
dropped to his side, his hand still clenched on the
weapon of death, reeking at the touch-hole and
muzzle. Jekyl ran to raise and support his friend,
and Captain MacTurk, having adjusted his spectacles,
stooped on one knee to look him in the face. &ldquo;We
should have had Dr. Quackleben here,&rdquo; he said,
wiping his glasses, and returning them to the shagreen
case, &ldquo;though it would have been only for
form's sake&mdash;for he is as dead as a toor-nail, poor
boy.&mdash;But come, Mowbray, my bairn,&rdquo; he said,
taking him by the arm, &ldquo;we must be ganging our
ain gait, you and me, before waur comes of it.&mdash;I
have a bit powney here, and you have your horse
till we get to Marchthorn.&mdash;Captain Jekyl, I wish
you a good morning. Will you have my umbrella<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_315" id="vol_ii_Page_315">[Pg&nbsp;315]</a></span>
back to the inn, for I surmeese it is going to
rain?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mowbray had not ridden a hundred yards with
his guide and companion, when he drew his bridle,
and refused to proceed a step farther, till he had
learned what was become of Clara. The Captain
began to find he had a very untractable pupil to
manage, when, while they were arguing together,
Touchwood drove past in his hack chaise. As soon
as he recognised Mowbray, he stopped the carriage
to inform him that his sister was at the Aultoun,
which he had learned from finding there had been a
messenger sent from thence to the Well for medical
assistance, which could not be afforded, the Esculapius
of the place, Dr. Quackleben, having been
privately married to Mrs. Blower on that morning,
by Mr. Chatterly, and having set out on the usual
nuptial tour.</p>

<p>In return for this intelligence, Captain MacTurk
communicated the fate of Lord Etherington. The
old man earnestly pressed instant flight, for which
he supplied at the same time ample means, engaging
to furnish every kind of assistance and support
to the unfortunate young lady; and representing to
Mowbray, that if he staid in the vicinity, a prison
would soon separate them. Mowbray and his companion
then departed southward upon the spur,
reached London in safety, and from thence went
together to the Peninsula, where the war was then
at the hottest.</p>

<p>There remains little more to be told. Mr. Touchwood
is still alive, forming plans which have no
object, and accumulating a fortune, for which he
has apparently no heir. The old man had endeavoured
to fix this character, as well as his general<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_316" id="vol_ii_Page_316">[Pg&nbsp;316]</a></span>
patronage, upon Tyrrel, but the attempt only determined
the latter to leave the country; nor has he
been since heard of, although the title and estates
of Etherington lie vacant for his acceptance. It is
the opinion of many, that he has entered into a
Moravian mission, for the use of which he had previously
drawn considerable sums.</p>

<p>Since Tyrrel's departure, no one pretends to guess
what old Touchwood will do with his money. He
often talks of his disappointments, but can never
be made to understand, or at least to admit, that
they were in some measure precipitated by his own
talent for intrigue and man&oelig;uvring. Most people
think that Mowbray of St. Ronan's will be at last
his heir. That gentleman has of late shown one
quality which usually recommends men to the favour
of rich relations, namely, a close and cautious care
of what is already his own. Captain MacTurk's
military ardour having revived when they came
within smell of gunpowder, the old soldier contrived
not only to get himself on full pay, but to
induce his companion to serve for some time as a
volunteer. He afterwards obtained a commission,
and nothing could be more strikingly different than
was the conduct of the young Laird of St. Ronan's
and of Lieutenant Mowbray. The former, as we
know, was gay, venturous, and prodigal; the latter
lived on his pay, and even within it&mdash;denied himself
comforts, and often decencies, when doing so
could save a guinea; and turned pale with apprehension,
if, on any extraordinary occasion, he ventured
sixpence a corner at whist. This meanness,
or closeness of disposition, prevents his holding the
high character to which his bravery and attention
to his regimental duties might otherwise entitle<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_317" id="vol_ii_Page_317">[Pg&nbsp;317]</a></span>
him. The same close and accurate calculation of
pounds, shillings, and pence, marked his communications
with his agent Meiklewham, who might
otherwise have had better pickings out of the estate
of St. Ronan's, which is now at nurse, and thriving
full fast; especially since some debts, of rather an
usurious character, have been paid up by Mr. Touchwood,
who contented himself with more moderate
usage.</p>

<p>On the subject of this property, Mr. Mowbray,
generally speaking, gave such minute directions for
acquiring and saving, that his old acquaintance, Mr.
Winterblossom, tapping his morocco snuff-box with
the sly look which intimated the coming of a good
thing, was wont to say, that he had reversed the
usual order of transformation, and was turned into
a grub after having been a butterfly. After all,
this narrowness, though a more ordinary modification
of the spirit of avarice, may be founded on the
same desire of acquisition, which in his earlier days
sent him to the gaming-table.</p>

<p>But there was one remarkable instance in which
Mr. Mowbray departed from the rules of economy,
by which he was guided in all others. Having
acquired, for a large sum of money, the ground
which he had formerly feued out for the erection of
the hotel, lodging-houses, shops, &amp;c., at St. Ronan's
Well, he sent positive orders for the demolition of
the whole, nor would he permit the existence of any
house of entertainment on his estate, except that in
the Aultoun, where Mrs. Dods reigns with undisputed
sway, her temper by no means improved
either by time, or her arbitrary disposition by the
total absence of competition.</p>

<p>Why Mr. Mowbray, with his acquired habits of<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_318" id="vol_ii_Page_318">[Pg&nbsp;318]</a></span>
frugality, thus destroyed a property which might
have produced a considerable income, no one could
pretend to affirm. Some said that he remembered
his own early follies; and others, that he connected
the buildings with the misfortunes of his sister. The
vulgar reported, that Lord Etherington's ghost had
been seen in the ball-room, and the learned talked
of the association of ideas. But it all ended in
this, that Mr. Mowbray was independent enough to
please himself, and that such was Mr. Mowbray's
pleasure.</p>

<p>The little watering-place has returned to its
primitive obscurity; and lions and lionesses, with
their several jackals, blue surtouts, and bluer stockings,
fiddlers and dancers, painters and amateurs,
authors and critics, dispersed like pigeons by the
demolition of a dovecot, have sought other scenes
of amusement and rehearsal, and have deserted <span class="smcap">St.

<h2><a name="vol_ii_AUTHORS_NOTES" id="vol_ii_AUTHORS_NOTES"></a>AUTHOR'S NOTES.</h2>


<h3><a name="vol_ii_Note_I" id="vol_ii_Note_I"></a>Note I., p. 202.</h3>

<p>There were several instances of this dexterity, but especially
those which occurred in the celebrated case of Murdison and
Millar, in 1773. These persons, a sheep-farmer and his shepherd,
settled in the vale of Tweed, commenced and carried on
for some time an extensive system of devastation on the flocks
of their neighbours. A dog belonging to Millar was so well
trained, that he had only to show him during the day the
parcel of sheep which he desired to have; and when dismissed
at night for the purpose, Yarrow went right to the
pasture where the flock had fed, and carried off the quantity
shown him. He then drove them before him by the most
secret paths to Murdison's farm, where the dishonest master
and servant were in readiness to receive the booty. Two
things were remarkable. In the first place, that if the dog,
when thus dishonestly employed, actually met his master, he
observed great caution in recognising him, as if he had been
afraid of bringing him under suspicion; secondly, that he
showed a distinct sense that the illegal transactions in which
he was engaged were not of a nature to endure daylight. The
sheep which he was directed to drive, were often reluctant to
leave their own pastures, and sometimes the intervention of
rivers or other obstacles made their progress peculiarly difficult.
On such occasions, Yarrow continued his efforts to
drive his plunder forward, until the day began to dawn, a
signal which, he conceived, rendered it necessary for him to
desert his spoil, and slink homeward by a circuitous road. It
is generally said this accomplished dog was hanged along with
his master; but the truth is, he survived him long, in the
service of a man in Leithen, yet was said afterwards to have
shown little of the wonderful instinct exhibited in the employment
of Millar.</p>

<p>Another instance of similar sagacity, a friend of mine discovered
in a beautiful little spaniel, which he had purchased<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_320" id="vol_ii_Page_320">[Pg&nbsp;320]</a></span>
from a dealer in the canine race. When he entered a shop, he
was not long in observing that his little companion made it a
rule to follow at some interval, and to estrange itself from his
master so much as to appear totally unconnected with him.
And when he left the shop, it was the dog's custom to remain
behind him till it could find an opportunity of seizing a pair
of gloves, or silk stockings, or some similar property, which it
brought to its master. The poor fellow probably saved its
life by falling into the hands of an honest man.</p>


<h3><a name="vol_ii_Note_II" id="vol_ii_Note_II"></a>Note II., p. 213.</h3>

<p>The author has made an attempt in this character to draw a
picture of what is too often seen, a wretched being whose heart
becomes hardened and spited at the world, in which she is
doomed to experience much misery and little sympathy.
The system of compulsory charity by poor's rates, of which
the absolute necessity can hardly be questioned, has connected
with it on both sides some of the most odious and malevolent
feelings that can agitate humanity. The quality of true
charity is not strained. Like that of mercy, of which, in a
large sense, it may be accounted a sister virtue, it blesses him
that gives and him that takes. It awakens kindly feelings
both in the mind of the donor and in that of the relieved
object. The giver and receiver are recommended to each
other by mutual feelings of good-will, and the pleasurable
emotions connected with the consciousness of a good action
fix the deed in recollection of the one, while a sense of gratitude
renders it holy to the other. In the legal and compulsory
assessment for the proclaimed parish pauper, there is
nothing of all this. The alms are extorted from an unwilling
hand, and a heart which desires the annihilation, rather than
the relief, of the distressed object. The object of charity,
sensible of the ill-will with which the pittance is bestowed,
seizes on it as his right, not as a favour. The manner of conferring
it being directly calculated to hurt and disgust his
feelings, he revenges himself by becoming impudent and clamorous.
A more odious picture, or more likely to deprave the
feelings of those exposed to its influence, can hardly be
imagined; and yet to such a point have we been brought by
an artificial system of society, that we must either deny altogether
the right of the poor to their just proportion of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_321" id="vol_ii_Page_321">[Pg&nbsp;321]</a></span>
fruits of the earth, or afford them some means of subsistence
out of them by the institution of positive law.</p>

<h2><a name="vol_ii_APPENDIX" id="vol_ii_APPENDIX"></a>APPENDIX.</h2>


<p>[The following extract from the proof-sheets containing Scott's
original conclusion of &ldquo;St. Ronan's Well&rdquo; was sent to the
Athen&aelig;um of Feb. 4, 1893, by Mr. J. M. Collyer. The proof-<span class='pagenum'><a name="vol_ii_Page_324" id="vol_ii_Page_324">[Pg&nbsp;324]</a></span>sheets
are in the possession of Mr. Archibald Constable. The
scene, of which a few lines remain in the authorised texts, is
that of Hannah Irwin's Confession to Josiah Cargill.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, most unhappy woman,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;what does your introduction
prepare me to expect?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your expectation, be it ever so ominous, shall be fully satisfied.
That Bulmer, when he told you that a secret marriage was necessary
to Miss Mowbray's honour, thought that he was imposing on you.&mdash;But
he told you a fatal truth, so far as concerned Clara. She
had indeed fallen, but Bulmer was not her seducer&mdash;knew nothing
of the truth of what he so strongly asseverated.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>He</i> was not her lover, then?&mdash;And how came he, then, to press
to marry her?&mdash;Or, how came you&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hear me&mdash;but question not.&mdash;Bulmer had gained the advantage
over me which he pretended to have had over Clara. From
that moment my companion's virtue became at once the object of
my envy and hatred: yet, so innocent were the lovers, that, despite
of the various arts which I used to entrap them, they remained
guiltless until the fatal evening when Clara met Tyrrel for the last
time ere he removed from the neighbourhood&mdash;and then the devil
and Hannah Irwin triumphed. Much there was of remorse&mdash;much
of resolutions of separation until the Church should unite them&mdash;but
these only forwarded my machinations&mdash;for I was determined
she should wed Bulmer, not Tyrrel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wretch!&rdquo; exclaimed the clergyman: &ldquo;and had you not, then,
done enough? Why did you expose the paramour of one brother to
become the wife of another?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She paused, and answered sullenly, &ldquo;I had my reasons&mdash;Bulmer
had treated me with scorn. He told me plainly that he used me
but as a stepping-stone to his own purposes: and that these finally
centred in wedding Clara. I was resolved he should wed her, and
take with her infamy and misery to his bed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is too horrible,&rdquo; said Cargill, endeavouring, with a trembling
hand, to make minutes of her confession.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; said the sick woman, &ldquo;but I contended with a master of
the game, who played me stratagem for stratagem. If I destined
for him a dishonoured wife, he contrived by his agent, Solmes, to
match me with a husband imposed on me by his devices as a man of
fortune,&rdquo; &amp;c.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>]</p>
